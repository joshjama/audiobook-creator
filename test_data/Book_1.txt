Delusion or Knowledge: Is This Guy Nuts,
or What?
1 Introduction to Section 1
Beginning with a partial biography of the author may appear to be
unnecessary and off the point. Ordinarily, an author's background is
adequately covered by a few paragraphs on the inside jacket of the
cover. However, understanding the origins of the author's experience
is where this adventure must begin. If you do not know anything at
all about me, the rest of this effort may wither on the conceptual vine
before it is ripe. This trilogy sets forth a Big Picture Theory Of
Everything (more concisely known as a Big TOE) that contains, as any
Big TOE must, a comprehensive model of reality.
Because My Big TOE is so unusual, so far away from the thoughts you
are probably used to thinking, it is important that you have some
understanding of the seed, soil, and roots from which this unusual
exposition sprang. Knowing its origins, the mental mettle from which
it has been hammered out, may help provide the context required to
assess the genuineness of My Big TOE.
This trilogy presents a working model of the larger reality based upon
the data I have collected through a lifetime of careful scientific
exploration. Section 1 describes how fate sent me down this highly
unusual path and then delivered me up to the extraordinary
experiences required to formulate the concepts presented in these
pages.
The intent is to give you some insight into who I am, where I am
coming from, and how I ended up with such an unusual Big TOE.
