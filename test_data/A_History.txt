13Concise History of the Modern World
Covering the major regions of the world, each history in
this series provides a vigorous interpretation of its region’s
past in the modern age. Informed by the latest scholarship,
but assuming no prior knowledge, each author presents
developments within a clear analytic framework.
Unusually, the histories acknowledge the limitations of
their own generalizations. Authors are encouraged to
balance perspectives from the broad historical landscape
with discussion of particular features of the past that may
or may not conform to the larger impression. The aim is to
provide a lively explanation of the transformations of the
modern period and the interplay between long-term change
and “defining moments” of history.

22Preface
This book covers well over 200 years of Latin American
history. It begins with a brief summary of European
colonialism, laying the groundwork for the succeeding
chapters on the history of the independent nation-states
that make up modern Latin America. Presenting such a
history is not easy: Latin America is immense and diverse;
events that have a huge impact on one nation or region
(such as the US war with Mexico in the 1840s), may affect
others only tangentially, or not at all. Moreover, textbooks
of this sort inevitably experience a crucial conflict. The
text should present a broad, general interpretation that
makes sense of many disparate details and events, yet it is
impossible to explore fully each and every event
undergirding the big picture. Another inevitable tension is
chronology (time) versus topics, as well as time versus
place (country or region). Since historical events build on
and grow out of whatever comes before and lead into and
influence that which comes after, it is very difficult to
extract a happening from its context, especially given the
many cultural, social, economic, and political contexts
surrounding every historical moment.
Historians must always grapple with this dilemma of
presentation: the author can stick to certain themes and
relay a general analysis fitted roughly into a chronology or,
alternatively, can relate the history of one country, or
group of countries, one at a time. The country-by-country
approach is often more precise, but difficult to use in the
standard history class, while covering many nations in one
full sweep can become confusing. Ultimately it really
23doesn’t matter which approach is used if the end product is
stripped of the fascinating stories and the lives of people
who contribute to the overall narrative.
This book presents Latin American history as seen through
the prism of social class, gender, race, and ethnicity.
Specific historical events and trends – such as the slave
revolt in Haiti, the patriarchal rules governing marriage in
Brazil, construction of the Panama Canal, or the Mexican
Revolution – are explained according to this interpretive
approach. The seemingly unconnected events in the
histories of Latin American societies come together in a
narrative that is more than the sum of its parts; rather the
parts, selected for their explanatory value, help us
understand the whole. Thus I present examples of what
transpired in a single nation at a specific time as
representative of a wider phenomenon and to serve as a
window into the ideas, conflicts, social movements,
cultural trends, and ascribed meanings that have made an
appearance on Latin America’s historical landscape. The
resulting interpretation derives from a process of sifting
and sorting through an immense amount of material;
choices have been made as to what to include and, often
with terrible regret, what to leave out.
Readers who seek a general level of analysis and broad
historical narrative will find it here. The book refers to and
describes major issues and events, drawing on many
valuable texts, monographs, document sets, journalistic
and fictional accounts of Latin America’s rich history. At
the same time, it was often necessary to allow one event to
serve as the archetypical illustration of important trends.
For example, a discussion of Argentina’s labor movement
24is used to reflect the struggle between workers and owners
that unfolded under specific conditions but also took place
in many countries. Labor in other areas is then covered in
broad strokes, with the assumption that readers and
instructors will draw on other examples to fill out the
narrative. I settled on this approach after more than 20
years of college teaching, mainly in a small liberal arts
institution, where it soon became apparent that students are
better able to grasp the big picture when given smaller,
concrete incidents to exemplify the story on which the
broader interpretation is based. Relying solely on “big
theories” and moving from country to country and event to
event makes students’ eyes glaze over and note-taking turn
to doodling. Blame could be placed on poor training in
geography, the ethnocentrism of US society, the internet,
or what have you, but the truth remains that we often
develop our understanding of history by building out from
a specific example or single historical event. Similarly, the
generalities of history often become clear when we focus
on a concrete example, or a few examples, to illustrate the
point.
Finally, history is based on original sources. The particular
interpretation historians have drawn from those sources,
even the conflicting conclusions they derive after looking
at the same or similar documents, is the heart and soul of
the enterprise. Interspersed throughout this narrative are
first-hand accounts, documents, and excerpts from fiction,
displayed in boxes. These boxes have two purposes. On
the one hand, they can serve as the basis of discussion in a
class; on the other, they demonstrate the kinds of materials
historians draw on to construct a narrative, thereby
allowing the reader of the text to critically judge the
25author’s interpretation. Although I am well aware that
readers sometimes skip over this additional material,
seeing it as irrelevant to the text, I am hopeful that
instructors and students will pause to examine an original
document, a quirky historical fact, and a literary comment,
in the course of reading the broader narrative. The use of
primary sources allows the reader and the student of
history to take up the analytical process for her or himself.
A Further Reading section at the end lists books chapter by
chapter for ease of reference.
In addition to documents and first-hand accounts, I have
also chosen to weave in historical, and also sometimes
fictional, asides, from various authors, including the
Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano. Galeano compiled a
three-volume “based on fact” fictional interpretation of
major events in the history of the Americas from the
pre-Columbian period to the late twentieth century. He did
this, he anthropomorphized, because “Poor History had
stopped breathing: betrayed in academic texts, lied about
in classrooms, drowned in dates, they had imprisoned her
in museums and buried her, with floral wreaths, beneath
statuary bronze and monumental marble.”1As a historian
and teacher, I naturally beg to differ a bit with his
conclusion, since those of us who teach and write strive to
present history as a lively narrative, not dull facts drowned
in dates. However, Galeano is right when he exhorts us to
rescue history from hero worship and to question the
sources, since neither they, nor the facts they present,
“speak for themselves.” In his trilogy Memory of Fire,
Galeano freely and provocatively writes the history of the
Americas. Drawing on documents, he creates a fanciful
26narrative of the past, which at points misses the mark and
at others nails it precisely.
In the end, we are all interpreters of history, trying to make
sense of our own past and our place within the era in
which we are living; and for that we rely on books and the
explanations contained within them. Although this History
of Modern Latin America is a very small contribution to
that daunting enterprise, I hope readers will find the events
and people who comprise the narrative of Latin America’s
past interesting, the explanation of that history
understandable and enlightening, and the interpretation
challenging. History should be nothing less.
27Acknowledgments
In the course of writing this book, I have been assisted by
many colleagues whom I am happy to acknowledge.
Christopher Wheeler, now at Oxford University Press, first
talked to me about this project over a drink at the
American Historian Association conference where we
discussed our mutual admiration for the work of Eric
Hobsbawm. I have never met Mr. Hobsbawm, but I want
to thank him for his many inspiring and profound insights,
as well as Christopher and Tessa Harvey at Blackwell for
the conversation that pulled me into this book. Many
thanks to Peter Coveney, my editor at Wiley-Blackwell,
who saw the book through to completion, and to his
assistants Deirdre Ilkson and Galen Smith, who
competently and cheerfully answered my millions of
queries along the way. My special thanks to Caroline
Richards for copyediting.
Colleagues and friends in Latin America and the United
States have assisted with comments, corrections, and
encouragement. I especially want to thank Cecilia Belej,
Susan Besse, Avi Chomsky, Alejandra Vassallo, Barbara
Weinstein, Ann Zulawski, and the anonymous readers for
their insights, clarifications, and advice. Over the years I
have accumulated a debt to my students at Union College
who worked as research assistants, proofreaders, typists,
contributors, and critics: Nancy Borowick, Heather
Cunningham, Colin Foard, Kelvin Martinez, Stacy Paull,
Jazmin Puicon, and Jessica Simpson. I especially want to
thank Jane Earley for her assistance with this book, the
Union College Faculty Development Grant for research
28and travel funds, and the librarians of Schaefer Library for
help tracking down sources.
Alison Raphael applied her copyediting wizardry to the
first draft and improved the prose. Working with Alison,
whom I have known since the mid-1970s when we met
researching our dissertations in Rio de Janeiro, was a
special treat. My sister, Martha Meade, read the entire
manuscript from start to finish, offered comments based on
her years of teaching high school history and caught a
number of errors. My family, Darren, Claire, and Andor
Skotnes, provided expertise with computers, photographs,
and technical and editorial advice. Andor, especially, I can
never thank enough.
It is impossible to acknowledge all the people who
contributed to this book, mainly because the process of
writing a textbook draws on the resources of an entire
profession. My debt is primarily to the many scholars who
have explored, analyzed, photographed, mapped, and
charted the history of Latin America. Compiling a
narrative from mountains of books, articles, web pages,
and news articles was both an inspiring and a humbling
experience. The scholarship on Latin America is truly
impressive; whatever errors and inadequacies remain in
this text are my own.

Introduction to the Land and Its People
Latin America is a vast, geographically and culturally
diverse region stretching from the southern border of the
United States to Puerto Toro at the tip of Chile, the
southernmost town of the planet. Encompassing over 8
million square miles, the 20 countries that make up Latin
America are home to an estimated 550 million people who
converse in at least five European-based languages and six
or more main indigenous languages, plus African Creole
and hundreds of smaller language groups.
Historians disagree over the origin of the name “Latin
America.” Some contend that geographers in the sixteenth
century gave the name “Latin America” to the new lands
colonized by Spain and Portugal in reference to the
Latin-based languages imposed on indigenous people and
imported African slaves in the newly acquired territories.
More recently, others have argued that the name originated
in France in the 1860s under the reign of Napoleon III, as a
result of that country’s short-lived attempt to fold all the
Latin-language-derived countries of the Americas into a
neocolonial empire. Although other European powers
(Britain, Holland, and Denmark) colonized parts of the
Americas, the term “Latin America” generally refers to
those territories in which the main spoken language is
Spanish or Portuguese: Mexico, most of Central and South
America, and the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico,
and the Dominican Republic. The former French
possessions of Haiti and other islands of the Caribbean,
31French Guiana on the South American continent, and even
Quebec in Canada, could be included in a broadened
definition of Latin America. However, this book defines
Latin America as the region that fell under Spanish and
Portuguese domination beginning in the late fifteenth and
into the mid-sixteenth centuries. The definition also
encompasses other Caribbean and South American
countries such as Haiti and Jamaica among others, since
events in those areas are important to our historical
narrative. This definition follows the practice of scholars in
recent years, who have generally defined Latin America
and the Caribbean as a socially and economically
interrelated entity, no matter what language or culture
predominates.
Geography
Latin America boasts some of the largest cities in the
world, including four of the top 20: Mexico City, São
Paulo (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia) and Lima (Peru). When
defined by greater metropolitan area – the city plus
outskirts – Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Rio de Janeiro
(Brazil) join the list of the world’s megacities, the term for
a metropolis of more than 10 million people. Population
figures, however, are controversial since most of these
gigantic urban centers include, in addition to the housed
and settled population, transitory masses of destitute
migrants living in makeshift dwellings or in the open air. It
is hard for census takers and demographers to obtain an
accurate count under those circumstances.
Not only does Latin America have some of the largest
population centers in the world, but its countryside,
32jungles, mountains, and coastlines are major geographical
and topographical landmarks (see Map 1.1). The
2-million-square-mile Amazon Basin is the largest
rainforest in the world. Spanning the far north of Brazil,
stretching into Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, French
Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela, it is home for
approximately 15 percent of all living species on the
planet. South and to the east of the Amazon Basin in the
Brazilian state of Mato Grosso lays the Pantanal, the
world’s largest wetlands. Other superlatives include the
highest mountain range of the Americas (the Andes) that
stretches nearly the entire length of the continent; second
in the world to the Himalayas of Asia in height, the Andes
are much longer, geologically younger, and very
seismically active. The Andean peak Aconcagua in Chile
is the highest mountain in the Americas, which at 22,834
ft. exceeds Dinali (Mt. McKinley) in Alaska by over 2,000
ft. The Atacama Desert, spanning Argentina, Bolivia, and
Chile, is the driest place on earth and the largest depository
of sodium nitrates on the planet. Elsewhere in the Andean
region is Lake Titicaca, the most elevated navigable body
of water in the world. This huge lake forms the boundary
between Peru and Bolivia, and the Bolivian city of La Paz
is the world’s highest-altitude capital city. Angel Falls in
Venezuela is the highest waterfall in the world; at 3,212 ft.
it is almost 20 times higher than Niagara Falls. Angel Falls
connects through tributaries to the world’s largest river (in
volume), the Amazon. In its 25,000 miles of navigable
water, this mighty “River Sea,” as the Amazon River is
called, contains 16 percent of the world’s river water and
20 percent of the fresh water on Earth.
People
33The sheer diversity of the population of Latin America and
the Caribbean has made the region extremely interesting
culturally, but has also affected the level of economic and
political equality. Latin America is exceedingly diverse, a
place where the interaction, cross-fertilization, mutation,
interpenetration, and reinvention of cultures from Europe,
Asia, Africa, and indigenous America has produced a
lively and rich set of traditions in music, art, literature,
religion, sport, dance, and political and economic trends.
Bolivia, for example, elected an indigenous president in
2005 who was a former coca leaf farmer. President Evo
Morales won easily with the backing of poor and
indigenous Bolivians but has met hostility from wealthy
and middle-class citizens who benefited from the country’s
natural gas exports and follow more “Western” traditions.
Thus ethnic and racial strife has accompanied synthesis
and cultural enrichment as cultures continue to confront
each other more than 500 years past the original
fifteenth-century encounter. (See Map 1.2.)

34In Bolivia and Peru people who trace their ethnicity back
to the pre-Columbian era constitute the majority, while in
Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela
people of mixed European and indigenous ancestry, known
as mestizos, constitute the majority. Africans were
imported as slaves from the sixteenth until the
mid-nineteenth centuries, and their descendants still
comprise over half of the population in many areas. People
in the Caribbean islands of Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
and Puerto Rico, as well as in many South American
nations, especially Brazil, are descendants of a mixture of
Africans and Europeans, called mulattos or
35Afro-descendant, a more appropriate term that refers to
heritage rather than race. Blacks are in the majority in
Haiti and in many of the Caribbean nations that were in the
hands of the British, Dutch, French, or other colonial
powers. Everywhere in Latin America there is evidence of
racial mixture, giving rise to the term casta, which the
Spaniards used to denote any person whose ancestors were
from all three major ethnic groups: indigenous, European,
and African. Although this has a pejorative connotation in
some regions, the creation of such a term suggests that
racial mixture in Latin America is so extensive as to make
it often awkward, and imprecise, to list each combination.
Large numbers of Europeans immigrated to Latin America
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In
addition to the majority who came from Spain, Portugal,
and Italy, immigrants arrived from France, Germany,
Poland, Russia, and the Middle Eastern countries of
Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon; a large number of Eastern
European and German Jews sought refuge in Latin
America both before and in the years immediately after
World War II. Many European migrants settled in the
Southern Cone countries of Uruguay, Argentina, Chile,
and the southernmost region of Brazil. Japanese also
immigrated to Brazil, especially to São Paulo, where they
were resettled on coffee plantations and eventually moved
into urban areas to form the largest community of Japanese
outside Japan. In addition, Japanese moved in large
numbers to Peru, while Koreans and Chinese migrated to
every part of Latin America. Chinese and East Indians
were brought as indentured servants to many of the
countries of the Caribbean region beginning in the
nineteenth and extending into the twentieth century.
36Because race in Latin America was from the earliest days
of the arrival of Europeans identified along a continuum
from indigenous and black at one end and white Europeans
at the other, any discussion of racial categories has been
very complicated. By contrast, the US largely enforced a
system of bipolar identity inherited from British
colonialism, which then solidified in the late nineteenth
century after the Civil War. Nonetheless, race everywhere
is socially constructed – for example, it is estimated that
nearly half of those who identify in the US as African
American have some white ancestors – and in Latin
America race is a conflicted category. Many Latin
Americans who identify as white, and are seen as white
because of their social status, education, and physical
features, might not be considered white in the US and vice
versa. There are any number of stories of black South
American diplomats who were outraged when they
encountered discrimination in Washington DC, not
because they objected to racial profiling, but because they
considered themselves white. It is estimated that of a total
population of 522.8 million in the countries of Latin
America, a third define themselves as white; a quarter as
mestizo (mixed white and Indian); 17 percent as mulatto/
Afro-descendant (mixed white and African); about 12
percent as Indian (with Peru and Bolivia as the only
countries with a majority Indian population); five percent
as black; less than one percent as Asian; and the remaining
as other/unknown (see Table 1.1).

country’s 1998 ratios [mestizo 67%, white 21%, black
10%, indigenous 2%] the yields for the entire region would
change slightly: Population 549,552,000; white 33.7%,
mestizo 33.3%, mulatto 16.4%, Amerindian or native
peoples 11.2%, 5.7%, black 5%, Asian 0.3%, other/
unknown 1.1%).
While exact figures are hard to determine, we can draw
several conclusions, the most salient of which is that
people who are wholly or partially of indigenous, African,
and Asian ancestry predominate in Latin America.
Certainly no discrimination against a minority should be
tolerated anywhere, but in Latin America it bears
remembering that the history of discrimination is against
the majority population, not the minority. Secondly,
whereas indigenous people constitute a minority in most
countries, people of whole or partial indigenous ancestry
comprise the single largest ethnic/racial group in Latin
America as a whole.
Economies
39Nature has graced Latin America with stunning natural
landmarks, but the gains achieved through human
interaction are not all positive since huge numbers of its
people are impoverished, while a small group in each
country is extremely wealthy. The World Bank calculates
that most of the population lacks basic services such as
water, sanitation, access to health care and vaccinations,
education, and protection from crime. Nearly 25 percent of
Latin Americans live on less than US$2.00 a day.
Although Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Chile rank as
the countries with the greatest inequality, the sheer
numbers of poor in Brazil and in Mexico pose some of the
greatest challenges to those nations’ resources. According
to United Nations development reports, lack of access to
basic infrastructure serves as a major impediment to
anti-poverty initiatives throughout the region.
Historians argue over the source of Latin America’s
inequality, some tracing it back to the days of European
conquest over large indigenous populations and centuries
of exploitation of imported African slaves. Others note that
Latin American leaders have failed to promote the type of
policies for the efficient exploitation of the continent’s vast
natural resources that would be required to raise the
standard of living of the majority of its people. Another
group points to the need to improve Latin America’s
commercial relations with the rest of the world, or to build
ties among themselves, as through the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which links Canada, the
US, and Mexico; the Central American Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA); MERCOSUR (called MERCOSUL
in English), which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay, and Venezuela; and the Andean Community of
40Nations (CAN), encompassing Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. A few nations, especially
Chile and Brazil, have pursued bilateral trade agreements
with the US, the European Union, and nations in Asia.
Similar initiatives by the Peruvian and Panamanian
governments to enter into trade pacts with the US have met
with stiff opposition from their local labor unions and
farmers.
The debates these agreements have generated do not focus
on trade per se, but on the long-term impact of entering
into compacts with larger, more developed, and
technologically more advanced nations. Critics charge that
Mexico has benefited little from NAFTA; in fact, NAFTA
has resulted in a flood of agricultural commodities into the
Mexican market from the US and Canada, where they are
produced far more efficiently and cheaply. As a result,
Mexican farmers have been driven off the land and into
urban squalor, or across the border to the US, in order to
survive. Critics of free trade pacts argue that the free flow
of capital the agreements nominally protect has proved
beneficial only to the rich nations, and perhaps to the
wealthy classes of emerging economies. They argue that
the pacts have accelerated income inequalities both within
Latin America and outside it, in relation to the rest of the
world. Contained within the trade debate is the larger issue
of neoliberalism, sometimes called the “Washington
Consensus,” referring to the push from the United States to
keep markets in developing nations open and available for
investment and trade agreements favorable to the US. The
real impact of foreign investment, and disagreements
among and between Latin American governments over the
41impact of earlier liberal and recent neoliberal policies, is a
topic that weaves through this text.
Although critics point to the detrimental impact of free
trade deals on agricultural production, especially in
Mexico, the fact is that most people throughout Latin
America live in cities. By 1960 the majority of the
population was involved in nonagricultural production;
that is, in the service sector, manufacturing, private and
public bureaucracies, and the informal sector. The
common assumption is that people making a living in the
informal sector – selling what they can on the street,
engaged in casual and day labor, or peddling “illegal”
wares and services – are very poor. That may be true, with
the exception of certain illegal activities such as
prostitution, trading in contraband, etc., in which case it is
hard to make any overriding assumptions. Yet some
entrepreneurs selling homemade crafts, foodstuffs and
other objects in local markets earn a very good living –
comparable to, or even better than, those employed in
manufacturing and the formal economy. The national
economy, however, may suffer because of the difficulty of
collecting taxes on informal-sector earnings.
A sizeable middle class has emerged in most of the
continent’s large cities, concentrated in growing domestic
and transnational manufacturing sectors, financial and
commercial institutions, government bureaucracies and
service sectors, and traditional professional occupations.
Probably owing to the precariousness of its position, the
middle class has not been a consistently strong voice in the
political arena. By the late twentieth century, however, this
42previously timid group had become a more sustained and
consistent actor in many emerging democracies.
Politics
The Latin American political landscape has been as
diverse as its geography and culture. Since the end of
Spanish and Portuguese colonialism in the nineteenth
century, the region has been host to monarchies, local
strongman (caudillo) rule, populist regimes, participatory
democracy of parliamentary, socialist, and capitalist
varieties, military and civilian dictatorships, and
bureaucratic one-party states, to name a few. The US has
played a strong role, especially during the twentieth
century. The lament of Mexico’s autarchic leader, Porfirio
Díaz, could be said to be applicable to the continent as a
whole: “So far from God, so close to the United States.”
British historian Eric Hobsbawm once remarked wryly that
Latin America’s proximity to the US has had the effect of
it being “less inclined than any other part of the globe to
believe that the USA is liked because ‘it does a lot of good
round the world.’”1
Latin America’s history is replete with conflict resulting
from the unequal distribution of resources among and
between nations, classes, racial and ethnic groups, and
individuals. In the nineteenth century Brazil, Argentina,
and Uruguay went to war against Paraguay from 1864 to
1870 in the War of the Triple Alliance. This devastating
conflict wiped out half of Paraguay’s population and over
80 percent of its men. The most extensive war, the
Mexican Revolution of 1910–21, resulted in the death of
an estimated one million people both on and off the
43battlefield, of a population of 15 million. Other
twentieth-century conflicts considered highly costly in
terms of human life were the War of the Chaco between
Bolivia and Paraguay (1932–5), in which an estimated
150,000 people died, and the civil conflict in Guatemala
(1978–96), in which at least 200,000 Guatemalan Indians
and mestizos were killed at the direction of a series of
brutal military regimes. The country whose history has
been most associated with violence is Colombia. From
1948 to 1966 an estimated 200,000–500,000 Colombians
(the number varies widely) died in a war between political
parties and factions that is known as La Violencia.
One erroneous stereotype, however, depicts Latin America
as exceptionally violent, as a place of war, unstable
governments, and social strife. In actuality, probably fewer
Latin Americans have died as participants in wars and
revolutions than is the case in other continents. This is due
in large part to the relatively small role Latin American
nations played in history’s major international
conflagrations, including World Wars I and II and Japan’s
war against China (1937–9). Unfortunately, the number of
casualties throughout the world has been tremendous: the
20–30 million who died in the Taiping Rebellion in China
(1850–64), the massacre of an estimated 1.6 million
Armenians in 1915–16, the World War II Holocaust, the
Cambodians left to die in the “killing fields” of Pol Pot
(1968–87), or the 1994 Rwanda Genocide in which
anywhere from 600,000 to one million Tutsis and their
Hutu sympathizers were killed in 100 days. The fact that
Latin Americans have not historically killed each other in
rebellions nor carried out mass slaughters in any greater
number than peoples in other parts of the world (and
44probably fewer) draws into question the cultural
stereotyping to which the region has been subjected.
In recent times, progressive and moderate leaders elected
to office in many countries of Latin America have
attempted to find solutions to the longstanding problems of
widespread poverty, malnutrition, lack of education,
human rights abuses, and inequality. This political
phenomenon, labeled the “Pink Tide,” refers to the
election in the last decades of the twentieth and early
twenty-first centuries of left and centerleft governments in
many Latin American countries, including Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay,
Venezuela, and, disputably, Nicaragua. As opposed to the
Cold War label, “the Red Tide,” that implied the spread of
communism from the Soviet Union and China to other
parts of the world, this “Pink Tide” is a milder, “less Red,”
political current. While many of these elected socialist and
leftist politicians are sympathetic to their own country’s
revolutionary past, have voiced open admiration for
Cuba’s stubborn rejection of US hegemony, and have
personally suffered under the military dictatorships that
dominated much of the region from the 1960s to 1990s,
they are at the same time proceeding cautiously. These
new, pragmatic leftists do not follow a single political
trajectory and have not attempted to forge a united front. In
fact, most seem to be content to remain loosely affiliated
ideologically, pursuing policies that benefit their own
nations while seeking the broadest level of cooperation
with like-minded, and even not so like-minded, neighbors.
Among the elected leaders, Venezuela’s President Hugo
Chávez is the most outspoken opponent of US policy in
45Latin America, and has forged close ties with Cuba’s
Marxist government. Chávez, leading a nation with
enormous oil reserves, can afford to be oppositional in a
way that, for example, Tabaré Vasquez, president of tiny
Uruguay, cannot. In Bolivia President Evo Morales has
supported the cultivation and sale of coca for medicinal
and nutritional uses, much to the alarm of Washington. On
the other hand, since Bolivia has the largest natural gas
reserves in the hemisphere, the US has moved cautiously
in mounting a critique. Similar to Chávez, with whom he is
closely allied, Evo Morales has used the clout of Bolivia’s
vital energy resources to bargain for better terms of trade
with international bodies and for the political space to
undertake a social reform agenda, despite objections from
the country’s traditional ruling circles. Both leaders face
powerful opponents inside their respective countries:
Chávez from the media, highly skilled petroleum workers,
members of the traditional elite, and from the growing
middle class. Morales has confronted a separatist
movement from the energy-rich eastern provinces. Both
leaders have faced showdowns over attempts to amend and
change their nations’ constitutions and curb democracy,
and both have scaled back plans for redistributing wealth
in the face of the economic crisis that began in 2008.
Michelle Bachelet, Chile’s second socialist president
elected since the demise of the military dictatorship in
1990, is one of very few female heads of state in the
history of the Americas (Figure 1.1). Interestingly, the
other women to head governments have all been in Latin
America, rather than the United States: Isabel Perón in
Argentina, 1974-6; Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua,
1990–6; Mireya Moscoso de Arias in Panama, 1999–2004,
46and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s first
elected female president in 2007. Bachelet’s government
has made some strides in promoting the rights of women
and taking on the issue of income inequality in Chile, but
her tenure in office has thus far remained tied to the more
moderate wing of the “Pink Tide.” In general, progressive
governments have found that the goal of providing social
benefits to the many poor, unhealthy, and uneducated
people in their respective countries must be balanced
against the fiscal discipline required to pay off the debt
burden they inherited from previous authoritarian and
military regimes. Many Latin American observers and
political pundits speculate that the leftist rhetoric at the
forefront of recent electoral campaigns has given way to
economic centrism and political maneuvering.

47These new leaders have likewise demonstrated a variety of
views on one of Latin America’s most enduring
institutions: the Catholic Church. Rafael Correa Delgado
was elected president of Ecuador in 2006 and assumed
office in January 2007. Considered one of the most recent
additions to the “Pink Tide” presidencies in Latin America,
Correa describes himself as a “Christian on the left” and as
a “twenty-first-century socialist.” After earning a degree
from the Catholic University of Guayaquil, Correa
volunteered for a year in a Salesian mission, an order of
Catholic priests known for their charity work with young
children, and seriously considered joining the priesthood.
Instead he opted for a PhD in economics from the
University of Illinois and a career in politics, but credits
48the Church for introducing him to social justice issues. In
many ways Ecuador’s new president illustrates the variety
of positions on religion apparent among the new crop of
progressive leaders. For example, Correa has voiced
political views in line with those of other left and
center-left presidents in Latin America, but does not share
Chilean Bachelet’s embrace of atheism, nor support
same-sex civil unions and reproductive freedoms as do the
Kirchners of Argentina, nor has he antagonized the church
hierarchy as has Chávez in Venezuela. The new president
of Paraguay, Fernando Armindo Lugo Méndez, is in fact a
former bishop, as well as a left-wing politician. What Lugo
will be able to accomplish is uncertain, since he heads one
of the poorest and smallest countries of Latin America.
Paraguay is still recovering from 35 years of military rule
under Alfredo Stroessner, who came to power in a military
coup in 1954 and was subsequently “re-elected” (often by
margins of 80 percent or more) over the next 35 years.
Stroessner’s decisions were funneled through the
compliant Colorado Party. Lugo’s election brought an end
to 61 years of Colorado rule and marked the first time in
Paraguay’s nearly 300-year history as a republic that a
ruling party surrendered power peacefully.
If presidents Correa and Lugo came to politics from a base
in Catholic activism, Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega
seems to have moved away from socialism and toward
religion. A former guerrilla commander who headed the
leftist Sandinista government in the turbulent 1980s, he
returned to power in 2007 under a political banner that
many argue includes few of the social reform measures or
promises of equality, especially for women, sought during
the earlier period. The Sandinista coalition recently split
49under a barrage of accusations of corruption against Ortega
and his closed circle of supporters. Because of his
acceptance of Christian fundamentalism, or because he
simply wants to curry favor with the Catholic hierarchy,
Ortega imposed a ban on abortion even in cases where the
mother’s life is in danger. Oddly, Tabaré Vasquez in
Uruguay has voiced the same position, promising to veto
reproductive rights legislation that passed in 2008 with
widespread backing from Uruguayan citizens. In religion,
as in politics and economics, the new leaders exhibit a
variety of ideological stances.
Culture and Entertainment
Latin America and the Caribbean is a crazy quilt of
nationalities, cultures, and language groups, representing
nearly every part of the globe and creating a profoundly
heterogeneous society from North to South. This diversity
is manifest in many aspects of Latin American culture.
Literature
Archeologists have deciphered over 15 pre-Columbian
distinct writing systems from Mesoamerican societies. The
ancient Maya had the most sophisticated textually written
language, but since texts were largely confined to the
religious and administrative elite, traditions were passed
down orally. The same was true of other major indigenous
groups including, but not limited to, the Aztecs and other
Nahuatl speakers, Quechua and Aymara of the Andean
regions, the Quiché of Central America, the Tupi-Guaraní
in today’s Brazil, the Guaraní in Paraguay, the Mapuche in
Chile.
50The contemporary reincarnation of an African and Indian
oral tradition can be found in the testimónio literature; the
best known, and controversial, example being the narrative
of the life of Rigoberta Menchú, a Guatemalan Indian
woman whose graphic account of the persecution of her
people in the 1980s has been widely read and translated
into many languages. Although there have been some
questions about the book’s veracity, Rigoberta Menchú’s
story gripped readers’ attention, much like Frederick
Douglass’s narrative of his life as a slave in the South of
the US a century earlier, because it was a first-hand
account. Her testimony brought to the world’s attention the
persecution of Native Americans in the hemisphere,
especially the genocide against the QuichéMaya of her
native Guatemala, where an estimated 200,000 people died
during a string of brutal military dictatorships from 1978 to
1996. For her efforts, she was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1992 on the 500th anniversary of the European
“discovery” of America.
Latin American literature has been particularly significant
in its contribution to the world of letters. Nicaraguan poet
Rubén Darío has a place among the greats of the Spanish
literary canon as the founder of modernism, a passionate,
visual, and stylized form of poetry that broke with
romanticism. Chile alone produced two of the major poets
of the modern era, both of whom were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Literature: Gabriela Mistral in 1945 and Pablo
Neruda in 1971. Mistral joins the small handful of women
worldwide who have received the prize in over a century
of its existence. Other Latin American Nobel laureates
include Miguel Angel Asturias (1967), a Guatemalan
author whose book El Señor Presidente set the standard for
51depictions of egomaniacal dictators; Colombian novelist
Gabriel García Márquez (1982), whose work, especially A
Hundred Years of Solitude, popularized the “magic
realism” literary genre; and Mexican poet, novelist, and
essayist Octavio Paz (1990), best known for A Labyrinth of
Solitude, a meditation on modern Mexico and the
unfulfilled goals of that nation’s turbulent 1910
Revolution.
The breadth and depth of literary production in Latin
America over the past two centuries is impressive. The list
includes Cuba’s José Martí, whose journalistic articles,
essays, and poems were published in Spanish and English
in the US, Latin America, and Europe during his exile
from Cuba in the late nineteenth century. Martí epitomized
the symbiosis of politics and art that is quite prevalent
among Latin American artists and writers, while others,
including Argentines Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges,
and Luisa Valenzuela, exemplify artists’ concern with
individual and existential crises. More overtly political
authors whose works are widely read in English include
Chile’s Isabel Allende, whose novel The House of the
Spirits is often considered one of the best descriptions of
the struggle against patriarchy. Julia Alvarez writes about
life growing up in the Dominican Republic and the US and
Rosario Ferré captures the impact of US colonialism on the
lives of Puerto Rican men and women. The 2008 Pulitzer
Prize for fiction went to The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar
Wao, Junot Díaz’s comment on the heartache and hilarity
of adjusting as a Dominican immigrant in Patterson, New
Jersey, while keeping one foot back on the island.
52Mexican novelist and political figure Carlos Fuentes;
journalist and essayist Elena Poniatowska; and Uruguayan
writer Eduardo Galeano have produced a prodigious body
of work that combines history, lyricism, and sharp political
analysis, mainly from the left. At the other end of the
political spectrum, Peruvian novelist and politician Mario
Vargas Llosa has long been an outspoken critic of the left.
Finally, Augusto Roa Bastos of Paraguay shares with the
Guatemalan Asturias a talent for capturing the personality
of authoritarian Latin American leaders, as seen in his
book I The Supreme. Brazilian writers Machado de Assis,
Jorge Amado, and Clarice Lispector draw on timeless
themes in that nation’s history, including the treatment of
women, the issue of racial and ethnic identity in a
multicultural society, nature and realism, and the
intersection of African and European-based spirituality in
modern society.
Visual arts
While Latin American visual art in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries borrowed closely from the traditions
of Spanish, Portuguese, and French classical and baroque
painting, much of it tied to religion, the influence of Africa
and indigenous cultures permeates most artistic
production. From the works of Colombian master painter
Fernando Botero, whose fat cherubs are a biting criticism
of Latin America’s elite, to the photography of Sebastião
Salgado, Brazil’s contribution to the use of the photograph
as a document, the world of Latin American visual art is as
critical and joyfully diverse as its people. Another
Brazilian, the architect Oscar Niemeyer, is considered one
of the inventors of the modernist style and creator of the
53use of reinforced concrete for constructing some of the
masterpieces of modern architecture, especially the United
Nations in New York and, with urban planner Lucio Costa,
the futurist capital city of Brasilia (Figure 1.2). In 1996, at
the advanced age of 89, he completed the Niteroi Museum
of Contemporary Art, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro.
A lifelong socialist, Niemeyer designed an elaborate
monument in Salvador da Bahia at the grave site of the
country’s most famous communist (who had trained as an
architect), Carlos Marighella.

Two major schools of painting that distinguish Latin
American artists in the mind of the world today are the
rich, colorful Haitian paintings that depict the complexity
of everyday life, and Mexican murals of the 1930s and
541940s, which project a radical interpretation of history. In
bold lines and dramatic colors, Haitian painting shows
everyday people involved in commonplace events. Art
historians assume this style of painting was common
among artists as far back as the early nineteenth century,
but it was not marketed commercially until the 1940s.
Formulaic reproductions of standard scenes in wondrous
colors can be bought from stalls in flea markets and on the
streets of many cities of the world where Haitian artists
peddle their wares; the highly skilled show their creations
in the major galleries of the world, selling for six-figure
dollar prices. Similarly, Mexican mural art links popular
subjects and high-art world prices. The most famous
muralists, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José
Clemente Orozco, told the story of Mexico’s history from
pre-Columbian times to the twentieth century Revolution.
They depicted the struggle for modernization and clash of
cultures, races, and classes in bold murals commissioned
by the government of Mexico. World famous for their
political and ideological brashness and competitiveness,
the muralists had a strong influence on Mexican and other
Latin American art. Likewise, they set the standard for an
art form that can be found on the walls of subways,
aqueducts, buildings, and fences throughout the world.
Frida Kahlo, whose work is today one the most popular
products of that era, is famous for her self-portraits that
spell out the physical and emotional pain she experienced
in life and, some argue, stands as a universalized statement
of women’s oppression. Although her personal life was
troubled, fraught with conflict with her husband Diego
Rivera, whose art and fame overshadowed her career
during her lifetime, Kahlo’s paintings today command the
highest prices of any Latin American artist.
55The most widely known forms of artistic expression in
many Latin American countries are handicrafts. Especially
in countries with a large indigenous population (such as
Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Mexico), textiles,
pottery, embroidery, weaving, crochet, and other crafts are
produced in homes and small workshops. In some parts of
the country young girls are withdrawn from school after
only a few years and put to work sewing, weaving, knitting
and otherwise producing the elaborate crafts that fill the
markets of small tourist towns, stops along the highways,
stores, and the huge open-air markets of capital cities. The
sheer quantity, variety, and ingenuity of crafts displayed in
any one market can be mind-boggling, while the income
from the sale of handicrafts is essential to the livelihood of
entire families and regions.
In the 1970s a new handicraft, the arpillera, was
developed and has since spread to many regions of Latin
America. Chilean women imprisoned under the
dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973–90) created these
three-dimensional textile pictures that depict a scene or tell
a story. The women developed the arpilleras as a way of
communicating with friends and families outside the
prison. Into the intricately sewn pictures the prisoners
incorporated sticks, pockets, pieces of aluminum foil and
other found items, all providing hiding places for
messages. The images in the arpillera, on careful
examination, revealed scenes of the torture, abuse, and
suffering that the women were enduring. Prison guards,
assuming the arpilleras were simple women’s sewing, did
not suspect that hidden within the folds of the fabric the
women were sending messages to the outside world of the
repressive conditions in Chilean prisons. The craft form
56spread from prisons to neighborhoods on the outside, and
later became a popular art form in communities in Chile,
Peru, and eventually throughout Latin America. Today
arpilleras represent a significant source of income for
women in cooperatives and shantytowns. They narrate life
stories, including events such as weddings and festivals,
show the day-to-day life in which women live and work,
plant and harvest crops, tend animals, cook, clean and care
for children.
Music and dance
Latin America’s diversity may be most readily apparent in
the rich variation of musical and dance forms. The thin,
austere chants of music from the Andean Altiplano reflect
indigenous sensitivities and invoke the harsh emptiness of
the highlands of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile, while
the pounding drumbeat and percussion of Brazil and the
Caribbean definitely draw their inspiration from Africa.
The Americas in general have elaborated on and enhanced
the world’s repertoire of sound, combining the instruments
of Africa with the strings and horns of European musical
tradition. Latin America’s contribution includes the samba,
marimba, merengue, cumbia, mariachi, reggae (and its
contemporary hip-hop permutation, reggaeton), salsa, cha
cha, bossa nova, and literally dozens of variations in
between. Samba in Brazil and tango in Buenos Aires, as
with jazz in the US, traveled a similar route from bawdy,
back-alley association with promiscuity and hot sex to
popularity on the world stage. Only after gaining
acceptance abroad were these musical and dance genres
embraced by their own national elites. Today, of course,
they are considered the emblematic music of their
57respective countries, promoted and practiced among all
social groups.
A key feature of Latin American music and dance is the
intermingling of styles and forms, drawing on the wide
variety of folk traditions and cultures developed in the
countryside in both African and indigenous societies, from
European imports, or blended with the latest in
international pop or classical music. One of the earliest
names to make its way to the world stage was that of
classical composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959), who
incorporated the native sounds of Brazil into classical
Europeaninfluenced pieces. The most famous name in
Latin American music is probably Carmen Miranda, a
Portuguese-born Brazilian who sported wild, fruit-bowl
hats in movies and stage acts. Extremely popular abroad
(she was the most highly paid actress in Hollywood during
the 1940s), her outlandish hats and “hot Latin” image were
seen by many Brazilians as a demeaning stereotype.
The 1960s Brazilian movement called tropicalismo –
developed by Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil (later
appointed as the Minister of Culture), Gal Costa, Maria
Bethânia, Tom Zé and others – was an expression of the
fusion of various musical forms, from Portuguese fado to
samba and bossa nova to contemporary Latin and
international rock and pop. Jon Pareles, music critic of the
New York Times, in an article recommending Veloso’s
albums Estrangeiro and Livro, has called Caetano Veloso
“one of the greatest living songwriters.”
As with Latin American literature, its music has played a
central role in criticizing conservative politics and human
58rights abuses and as a tool for bolstering movements for
social change, many of them on the left. Victor Jara, a
famous Chilean folk singer who was tortured and killed in
the early days of the 1973 military coup against Salvador
Allende’s socialist government, was part of a Latin
America-wide folk revival, the New Song Movement (la
Nueva Canción). The movement was inspired by the work
of Argentine folk singer Mercedes Sosa and Chile’s
Violeta Parra. The large instrumentalist and choral groups
Quilapayún and Inti-Illimani popularized the music of the
New Song movement in concerts throughout the world,
both during the heady days of the Allende government and
later during the Pinochet dictatorship as they traveled the
world in exile.
Today’s music scene has seen a blending of styles from
Latin America, the United States, and Europe. The borders
that previously separated the Americas are now porous for
both people and music; Latin American rhythms regularly
float from mainstream US and European radio. Carried
with the migrant culture, Latin pop has introduced new
forms of hip-hop that bears the stamp of plena and bomba
styles from Latin America, incorporates the strong social
critique often expressed in US rap music and, regrettably, a
fair share of misogynist and violent lyrics. The rhythm of
Latin music accompanies the migration of people from
Latin America into major urban areas and even into the
more sparsely settled Midwestern heartland.
Cinema and television
At the 2006 Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles,
critics were abuzz with commentary on the “Three
59Amigos,” an adaptation of the title of a 1986 slapstick
comedy starring Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin
Short. In 2006 the “three friends” were Mexican film
directors Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro González Iñárritu,
and Alfonso Cuarón. Each had directed and produced
movies that were in contention for the top prizes, including
Best Picture. That these filmmakers had Oscar-nominated
movies was not as novel as the fact that the movies in
contention (Pan’s Labyrinth, Children of Men, and Babel)
were not based in Mexico, nor did they star or pertain to
Latin American personalities or themes. Their earlier
movies, such as Y tu mamá tambien, Amores Perros, 21
Grams, had brought actors Gael García Bernal and Diego
Luna to the attention, and admiration, of a young US
audience. The fame of today’s Latin American directors
builds on a line of cinematic achievements stretching back
to Black Orpheus, the 1959 Brazilian movie by French
director Marcel Camus. This adaptation of the classic
Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice set in Rio de
Janeiro during Carnival introduced the world to Brazilian
culture, music, and racial themes. It won the Palme d’Or at
the Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Oscar and Golden
Globe for Best Foreign Film (for France).
The 1960s and 1970s brought international success to
Argentine director Fernando Solanas (Hour of the
Furnaces) and Chilean Patricio Guzmán (Battle for Chile),
whose powerful political documentaries captured the
imagination of young people in the US and Europe. The
directors interspersed news footage with a montage of
symbols from political struggles in other countries, as well
as snippets of acting and drama, to create cinema verité
documentary films. Argentina had been a leader in the
60early years of the twentieth century, but suffered under the
military government from 1976 to 1983 only to re-emerge
with an Academy Award-winning film, The Official Story,
in 1985. The country has since begun a frenzy of
filmmaking, with a number of critically acclaimed movies,
including Social Genocide, Solanas’s 2004 exposé of
corrupt politicians who sold off Argentine resources and
bankrupted the economy.
Brazil’s film industry, the largest and best financed in the
region, has produced well-known directors such as Walter
Salles (Central Station), Bruno Barreto (Dona Flor and
Her Two Husbands), Hector Babenco (Kiss of the Spider
Woman), and several wellreceived films about harsh life in
the favelas (shantytowns) and on the streets of São Paulo
and Rio de Janeiro, including Pixote, City of God, Bus 174,
and the most controversial, The Elite Squad, winner of
various film festival prizes. Finally, Cuban films, such as
Memories of Underdevelopment, a studied meditation on
the role of the intellectual in the early days of the
Revolution and the choice between staying in Cuba or
going into exile, along with Strawberry and Chocolate,
Lucía, Portrait of Teresa, Before Night Falls, and The Last
Supper, have won for Cuba a place in the international
cinema arena. This is quite astonishing considering Cuba’s
tiny size, small capacity for filmmaking, scarce resources,
and the intrusive oversight of official censors.
Although film has achieved international commendation,
most Latin Americans watch television far more than
movies. Not all Latin American households have a
refrigerator, but most have a television – essential for
watching soccer games, news, and the nighttime soap
61operas or telenovelas. The telenovela, one of the most
widespread expressions of popular culture in Latin
America, is a basic staple of both daytime and nighttime
programming and the main source of support for many
channels. Like soap operas, which some consider a distant
North American cousin, the telenovela examines personal
and family themes. Plots revolve around power relations in
work and domestic settings, “bad” women, love rivalries
and triangles, and paternity disputes. According to
sociologist José Antonio Guevara, the typical telenovela
theme is the struggle to found a traditional family: falling
in love, marrying, and having children. It pursues this
theme by showing the contrasting lives of rich and poor,
good and evil. From this tension the melodrama develops
its plot, which is often based on a projection of reality
drawn from an historical event or torn from the pages of
the news, like some police, courtroom, and hospital dramas
shown on US television. Whereas soap operas never end
(unless they go off the air) since the events with which its
characters struggle are timeless and cannot be solved, the
goal of the telenovela is to solve the problems of society,
usually in a three-to-four month series, and even to teach a
way to resolve the tensions inherent in the progress of
human events.
Since telenovelas play at night, they are a main source of
entertainment for entire families, even entire communities
and nations (including millions of US Hispanic
households). The plot will be discussed at the office the
next day and become part of the analogies, references, and
metaphors around which day-to-day life is constructed.
The telenovela, to borrow a phrase from Italian theorist
Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), is, in terms of
62entertainment, hegemonic; that is, it depicts and preaches
the “shared common sense” of Latin America culture.
Sports
Latin America has a broad and varied array of athletic
competitions, although fútbol (called futebol in Brazil and
soccer in the United States) is probably the most
widespread national pastime. British sailors introduced
soccer to most South American countries in the latter half
of the nineteenth century when they played pick-up games
while on shore leave, sometimes among themselves and
then increasingly with local youths. Charles Miller, the son
of a Paulista merchant, is thought to have brought two
soccer balls from England to Brazil in the 1890s with the
purpose of setting up matches between teams of young
British employees of the Gas Company, the London and
Brazilian bank, and the São Paulo Railway Company. In
Brazil, as in other Latin American countries, European
football was eventually absorbed into the lives of working
men and boys. A game that can be played anywhere,
requiring only a ball and a few eager players, it was easily
adopted by the working poor, some of whom made do with
less than a ball. Today innovative boys can be seen on
vacant lots or in the street, passing wadded up balls of
paper or string, crushed cans, or some other makeshift ball
with the same fancy footwork one might expect to find in
an official game with a regulation ball. Brazil is the only
country to have won five World Cups, but its lackluster
performance in 2006 and charges of corruption in the
coaching and team selection process have led to some
disillusionment with the team. As with many teams from
Latin America and Africa, Brazil’s performance may
63suffer because the team only plays together during World
Cup competitions every four years, since most players live
abroad while pursuing lucrative professional careers with
teams in Europe, Canada, and the US. Nonetheless, soccer
remains the top spectator sport in most Latin American
nations, dominating the airwaves and, some might argue,
the national psyche.
In parts of the Caribbean and Central America beisbol
outshines soccer in terms of popularity. The sport took
hold especially in the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the
late nineteenth century, when sugar companies imported
cane cutters from the British Caribbean. The workers
played cricket in their free time, but later, during the long
periods of US military occupation, cricket gave way to
baseball and rapidly assumed widespread popularity,
although cricket remains the favorite in the British
Caribbean. Baseball has the greatest following in those
nations occupied at length by the US military, especially,
Nicaragua, Panama, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican
Republic. These countries have also emerged as sources of
baseball talent, since many players hone their skills on
local teams, or in “academies” managed by the US Major
Leagues to cultivate the most promising young men for
their own teams.
Critics charge that the Major Leagues exploit players from
poor backgrounds, signing them to contracts at prices far
below what US players would command and robbing
small, much poorer, countries of their best talent. Others
argue that players now negotiate through shrewd lawyers
and agents to obtain top-rung salaries. Both baseball and
soccer create, nurture, and then export great players for the
64sports industry in developed countries – a process not
unlike that accorded to other Latin American
“commodities.” Only in Cuba does a top-notch national
team compete on its own turf and in international
competitions, winning numerous gold medals at the
Olympic Games. Nonetheless, even Cuba contributes
talent to the Major Leagues, most recently through the
defections of players such as José Contreras, and
half-brothers Liván and Orlando (El Duque) Hernández.
The drain of sports talent, like that of Latin America’s
skilled professionals, workers and the poor, will probably
continue as long as the dramatic income inequalities
between the US and countries to the south persist.
All in Latin America is not soccer and baseball, however.
A look at the competitions and medal winners at the last
few Olympic Games illustrate the breadth of sports in the
region. For example, although Argentina is a perennial
powerhouse in soccer and produced one of the game’s
legendary players, Diego Maradona, it was the Women’s
Field Hockey team that brought home the most Olympic
medals from Sydney (2000), Athens (2004), and Beijing
(2008). The women returned to Argentina as national
heroes, especially Vanina Oneto who scored four goals in
the championship match against New Zealand. The
Argentine women’s field hockey teams are among the best
in the world, followed by the men’s teams. Peruvian and
Brazilian women’s volleyball teams are top contenders in
international matches, while in wrestling, boxing, and
many powerful track and field events Cuban men and
women rank first or second in the world. The Olympics
and Pan-American Games have served as a showcase for a
variety of talented athletes, although the Olympics were
65only once hosted in Latin America. The 1968 games in
Mexico City entered the history books for several firsts,
including the first time a woman, Enriqueta Basilio, a
Mexican hurdler, lit the Olympic Torch. It was also the
first time that African distance runners swept up the
medals, in part because they had trained at high altitudes
and were not handicapped by Mexico City’s location at
6,000 feet above sea level. The 1968 Olympics elicited the
most protests, including the Black Power salute on the
winners’ block from the US medalists as a mark of
solidarity with the African-American Civil Rights
movement. Finally, the 1968 games were preceded by a
brutal massacre of students in Tlatelolco Square, in
downtown Mexico City, a month before they opened. The
event drew attention to the repressive single-party
government that had ruled Mexico since the 1930s and
which had poured massive amounts of money into
preparations for the international athletic competition
while the majority of Mexicans continued to live in
desperate poverty.
Despite Latin American nations having fielded many
teams in the Olympics, the games have never returned to
the continent and the Olympic Torch only passed through
Latin America for the first time in 2004 on its way to the
games in Greece. On June 13, 2004, one of the world’s
foremost athletes, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, known to
the world as Pelé, ran through the streets of Rio de Janeiro
with the torch before passing it on. Pelé, one of the most
skilled players in the history of soccer, led his team to two
World Cup victories in the 1960s and is frequently credited
with bringing Brazil to the forefront of world competition.
In July 2008 at the age of 67 Pelé opened the game in Cape
66Town, South Africa at a world soccer match
commemorating former president Nelson Mandela on his
90th birthday.
Latin America: Past and Present
Today it is impossible to consider the future of the United
States without taking into account the countries of Latin
America. Whereas politics, wars, perennial crises, major
celebrations and commemorations in other parts of the
world may take center stage at one time or another, the
people and cultures of Latin America remain one of the
foremost external influences on life in the US. From
concerns over drug trafficking in Colombia and Mexico to
the latest Latin American singing sensation, to the
neverending debate over border patrols and immigration
policy, the past, present, and future of the United States
and Latin America are interwoven, straddling their
respective political, economic, and cultural landscapes. For
that reason alone it is essential that US students (large
numbers of whom trace their origin to the countries of the
Caribbean, Central and South America), as well as the
general public, learn and understand the history of this
vital region of the world.
Latin America is not simply a neighbor to the United
States. It has produced worldclass athletes, artists,
musicians, writers, filmmakers, scientists, inventors,
politicians, and more. The fate of its rivers, wetlands, and
rainforests, and of the thousands of plants, animals, and
natural resources they produce, matters to us all and affects
the quality of life on Earth. Latin America is a tremendous
repository of resources, but it is likewise a land whose
67people, along with the languages they speak and the
cultures they reflect, are having a major impact on the
entire world, not just its northern neighbors.

Latin America in 1790
The early history of Latin America was a period of
fighting over privilege: to possess it, dispense it, or usurp
it. Privilege became the basis for rule according to an
unwritten code followed by the rich and powerful
throughout most of the hemisphere. These layers of
privilege and power were wielded through succeeding
historical eras, first by Indian rulers, and then European
conquerors and men of European descent; the Catholic
Church; the wealthy; the strong; the cunning and
resourceful; the physically, mentally, and militarily
skillful; and even by the gods of one or another religion.
During the late eighteenth century profound
transformations began to convulse societies in Europe and
the Americas to their core. Beginning earlier in the
century, and reaching intensity in the revolutions of 1776
and 1789, philosophical, political, and social forces
combined to produce explosive and irrevocable
revolutionary changes. After years of back-and-forth
rebellion and retaliation, and eventual armed conflict, the
colonies in North America successfully separated from
England and formed a new federation of the United States
of America in 1788. The following year France exploded
in a revolution more profound and far-reaching than
anything before known in Europe, precipitating an uprising
in the French slave colony of Saint-Domingue (later Haiti).
In southern Europe the monarchies of Spain and Portugal
were doing their best to suppress the spread of
70Enlightenment broadsides and revolutionary calls to arms
both at home and in their colonies, only to fail as
republicanism upended the political balance of power in
Spain just as it had in other parts of Europe. In the
Americas ideas of free trade, separation of Church and
state, and anti-monarchical republicanism were stirring a
new generation of Creole nationalists.1
In Spain, the
moribund Hapsburg Empire had given way early in the
century to the more dynamic French House of Bourbon,
ushering in an era of “enlightened despotism.”
The Bourbons set about shoring up the Spanish empire by
imposing taxes, reorganizing the colonial administration,
eliminating widespread graft and smuggling, and generally
seeking to make the empire a viable enterprise. The
Bourbon Reforms, begun in mid-century, reached full
force by 1790. The Portuguese equivalent, the Pombaline
Reforms (named for their architect, the Marquês de
Pombal), followed a similar trajectory. Examining the
depth and extent of these reforms opens a window onto the
social order that had been in place since the earliest days of
conquest, and hints at the dramatic changes that would
sweep the Americas in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. The reforms were, however, a
desperate move, and ultimately a futile one, as the same
spirit that impelled its North American neighbors to seek
independence from Britain, and the French Jacobins to
overthrow the ancien régime of Louis XVI, gave rise to
slave revolts, street rioting, and demonstrations against
taxes and high prices in the cities and countryside from the
Caribbean to the Southern Cone. The masses of Latin
America pushed forward a more radical agenda to replace
the reformist goals of Iberian monarchs.
71In order to understand the reasons for the
eighteenth-century reforms, and the rebellions they
provoked, it is necessary to review the colonial world
established by the Spanish and Portuguese, especially the
use they made of the land, their method of extracting profit
and sustenance from labor, and the economic and political
regulations that governed the peoples of their empires. As
in all monarchies and authoritarian states – of which the
Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires in the Americas
were prime examples – privilege and power changed hands
depending on the outcome of war, conquest, and survival,
as well as conditions of ethnicity and gender. In the
colonial world, however, power and privilege can be
traced through ownership of property, especially land and
mines, and control over the labor supply.
Colonial Background
Spain designed the model for colonial administration, and
with a few variations Portugal followed a similar pattern.
From the earliest days of the Spanish occupation of the
Americas, the Crown had moved quickly to establish a
vast network of political and economic oversight, since it
was soon apparent that the tremendous wealth of the
Americas – a wealth that accrued to the colonists who
traveled and settled there as much as to the Crown’s
coffers on the other side of the ocean – could quickly
outstrip that of the Old World aristocracy. Hernán Cortes
(ca. 1484–1547), a minor noble who had brazenly
disobeyed his superiors when he set off on his dangerous
trek into the central valley of Mexico, was worth today’s
equivalent of approximately $2.5 million seven years after
capturing the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán in 1521.
72Francisco Pizarro (ca. 1478–1541), the illegitimate son of
a peasant woman and an absent father who never
acknowledged him, became an exceedingly wealthy and
powerful man after his conquest in 1532 of the region that
would become Peru. At Cajamarca he held hostage the
Inca ruler Atahualpa, forcing him to turn over a ransom
amounting to 11 tons of worked gold, and then killed the
king in a brutal and bold move to demonstrate the
Spaniards’ power. The 221
/2 carat gold statuary and
religious icons that the Incas provided for the release of
their ruler, the Spanish troops melted down into gold bars
worth an estimated $17.5 million. For their contribution to
the triumph every foot soldier in the regiment was given
500 pieces of gold, a fortune at the time, and an
inconceivable booty for the motley band of mostly
illiterate, peasant soldiers from the barren plains of
Estremadura in southern Spain.
As early conquest evolved into colonization and
administration, the acquisition of real gold and silver
became increasingly uncommon and Conquistadores began
to acquire wealth instead through the encomienda, a
Spanish feudal trusteeship meaning “entrustment.” A
controversial institution, and one that would soon come
under attack both for its brutality and for the vast wealth it
placed into the hands of a very few conquerors, the
encomienda had developed in the south of Spain. It was a
method of extracting labor and tribute from the Muslims
(called Moors), who had resided in Catholic Spain before
they were expelled in 1492 when the Islamic armies were
defeated at the battle for the fortressed city of Granada.
This system, intended as a way of rewarding soldiers and
moneymen alike who triumphed against the Moors, then
73traveled to the New World where the Crown granted to the
recipient, called an encomendero, the right to extract labor
and tribute from the Indians who fell under Spanish
authority in the wake of the Conquest.2 Christopher
Columbus (ca. 1451–1506) instituted the encomienda quite
soon after his arrival and settlement on the island of
Hispaniola, requiring the indigenous population to pay
gold tributes (which were quite scarce) to their masters or
face brutal punishment. In return Columbus, and
subsequent Spanish overlords, were required to ensure that
the Indians were baptized, protected from harm, and had
access to the rituals and services of the Catholic Church.
The Crown utilized this system of rewards to encourage
the settlement and further conquest of the New World.
The Spaniards, including the encomenderos, the official
government agents of the Crown, and the many hundreds
of ordinary settlers who made their way across the Atlantic
all sought to reap the wealth of the New World by drawing
on organized work routines, the system of tribute
collection, and resource management already in place in
the indigenous communities. The indigenous communities
of the Americas were of many different types, following
no single pattern of social organization. It is, therefore,
unwise, if not impossible, for historians to describe the
interaction between colonists and colonized as a uniform
model. Where feasible, however, colonial authorities
attempted to build from the pre-existing social structure.
From the time of the Europeans’ first landing on the island
of Hispaniola (today the Dominican Republic and Haiti),
the conquerors would identify an Indian leader whom they
called a cacique, and it was with him (occasionally her)
74they sought to negotiate for labor, tribute, and gold. This
process of using caciques as brokers between the Spanish
conquerors and the Indian communities was established in
the Caribbean and carried over to the mainland expeditions
in Mexico and South America. There is considerable
controversy among scholars regarding the contours of this
interaction. It appears, however, that in some areas
caciques resisted Spanish rule, especially when the latter
demanded more and more work from an ever-declining
indigenous population. A cacique who refused to
cooperate with the Spaniards was eliminated and a new
one was appointed, holding the position so long as he
proved useful to the Spaniards.
Caciques, or whomever they delegated to carry out the
task, answered to an appointed Spanish official within the
royal bureaucracy whose job it was to make sure each and
every Indian community turned over a determined amount
of labor and wealth to the Spaniards. These officials, called
corregidores, were granted this privileged position because
they came from influential families in Spain, or because
they paid the Crown a sum of money in return for the
appointment. Either way, they were the linchpins of the
system of colonial domination. They served as the
intermediary between the Crown, the viceroy at the top of
the colonial administration and the wealth of the Americas,
ensuring that the fruit of indigenous labor (in mining,
farming, sweatshops, or other production) was turned over
to the Spaniards. The problem was that the Indians could
not meet the impossibly high quotas set for them,
especially as they sickened and died in massive numbers to
the newly imported European diseases to which they had
no immunity. These appointed officials also managed the
75demands of merchants and landowners anxious to reap the
maximum amount of profit from Indian labor. A man in
this position served as overseer, census taker, negotiator,
slave driver, and Crown official all in one, and was in line
to became the richest, most powerful, and most hated (by
the Indians) official in the colony.
Although most of the earliest settlers were men, some
women also accrued land grants from the Crown through
inheritance, the death of a husband, or recognition of their
achievements by royal authorities. One interesting case is
that of María Escobar, who in addition to holding large
plots of lands after being twice widowed, was given a
grant of Indian laborers in sixteenth-century Lima as a
reward for her aid in the introduction of wheat production
in the region. When antagonistic officials tried to take her
holdings away because of her gender, she fought through
legal means to hold onto her slaves and her property,
serving as an example of the ability of some Spanish
women, albeit few, to achieve great wealth and prestige in
colonial society. The most celebrated conquistadora was
Inés de Suárez (1507–80), a Spanish woman who traveled
to the Americas from a small town in Extremadura, Spain
in search of her ne’er-do-well husband. When she arrived
in Cuzco and learned that he was dead, she managed to
procure a small encomienda. She prospered as a baker and
apparently had a talent for finding water which she had
learned from her mother in Spain. The latter was of no
small value in the arid and barren climate of the Peruvian
altiplano. Inés Suárez became the mistress of Pedro de
Valdivia, a high officer in Pizarro’s army who had left a
wife behind in Spain, and accompanied him on his
exploration and eventual conquest of Chile. Known as a
76skilled and cunning fighter, she participated in the defense
of Santiago when the town came under attack from the
indigenous Mapuche in 1541. Eventually she married
Rodrigo de Quiroga, the Royal Governor of Chile. She
outlived most of her companions, and left a diary which
has been the source for numerous novels, including one by
Isabel Allende.
In 1544 the Crown outlawed Indian slavery for a
combination of reasons. On the one hand, the rapid
disappearance of the native people alarmed some in the
Catholic Church who felt that the Indians were being
worked to death, even before the priests and friars could
baptize and win to Christianity this enormous population.
As a result of the tireless efforts of the Dominican Friar
Bartolomé de las Casas (1484–1566) to expose the
maltreatment of the native people, the Spanish Crown
conducted a famous debate at the Court in Spain to
determine the conquerors’ right to enslave the Indians. In a
book, A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies,
published in 1552, Las Casas detailed the torture of the
Indians who were forced to work in the mines of the
Caribbean islands and who were sickening and dying. By
the time the Crown’s ruling reached the Americas and
went into effect, so many Indians had died as to make their
enslavement impossible in many parts of the realm.
African slavery was not prohibited and thus became the
preferred alternative among the European colonists,
especially in the Caribbean and Brazil.
The original inhabitants of the Caribbean islands
disappeared almost completely, as did populations in
lowland Brazil, the Amazon, and other areas around the
77Caribbean Sea. In Mexico anywhere from 50 to 90 percent
of the indigenous population was killed off, mainly by
disease. In Peru, 82 million people died of disease and
overwork in the 250 years from 1540 to 1800. Everywhere
there were dramatic declines: in the Caracas Valley of
Venezuela a smallpox epidemic wiped out twothirds of the
Indian population, reducing it from 30,000 to 10,000 in a
few years around 1580; virtually the entire indigenous
population of the Caribbean islands disappeared due to
disease, overwork, brutality, and other effects of their
encounters with Europeans.
Some argue that the decimation of the indigenous
population of the Americas could be considered genocide,
which according to the definition developed by the Geneva
Conventions after World War II is a crime “committed
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” Although the
devastating effect of colonization on the Indians of the
Americas does not fit precisely this definition, there have
been cases when native populations were intentionally
decimated, especially in Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, and
parts of Eastern and Western North America, both during
the colonial period and into the present day (see Box 2.1).
Scholars note that the full-scale destruction of the
indigenous people of the Americas may not technically be
classified as genocide, since for the most part their demise
was unintentional. Nonetheless, they and their
communities were destroyed physically and culturally as a
result of the European invasion, which might amount to
the same thing.
78Although of comparatively short duration, Indian slavery
institutionalized in the colonies the custom of ruthlessly
exploiting laborers who were not white or European, and
not even fully Christian, for the enrichment of a powerful
elite that divided control among itself. The encomienda, as
the first form of slavery in the Americas, therefore was the
foundation for the system of relations between laborers
and owners, elites and peasants, that has remained
unchanged in parts of Latin America today. What is more,
while according to the law Indian slavery was illegal after
the mid-sixteenth century, it remained in place in many
outlying, remote regions of the empire, in some cases into
the eighteenth century. Beginning in the seventeenth
century, labor was organized under a system of debt
peonage and near slavery of Indians, and chattel slavery of
Africans, on big estates called haciendas or estancias, in
Spanish America, and fazendas and engenhos, or
plantations, in Brazil and the Caribbean. Having
long-established ties and interconnections with Europe, the
people of Africa had immunity to many of the diseases that
had decimated the indigenous population. Inordinately
high death rates continued, however, so that even in the
seventeenth century, one of every five miners working
under conditions of near slavery in the massive mountain
of silver at Potosí (present-day Bolivia) met his death.
Box 2.1 “The Pestilence”: Couri, 1586
Eduardo Galeano portrays a native call for the
rejection of Christianity. This was at least one
79Indian’s subversive solution for the plagues that
were devastating his people in Peru.
Influenza does not shine like the steel sword, but
no Indian can dodge it. Tetanus and typhus kill
more people than a thousand greyhounds with fiery
eyes and foaming jaws. The smallpox attacks in
secret and the gun with a loud bang, amid clouds of
sparks and sulfurous smoke, but smallpox
annihilates more Indians than all the guns. The
winds of pestilence are devastating these regions.
Anyone they strike, they blow down: They devour
the body, eat the eyes, close the throat. All smells
of decay. Meanwhile, a mysterious voice ranges
over Peru. It treads on the heels of the pestilence
and penetrates the litanies of the dying, this voice
that whispers, from one ear to another: “Whoever
throws the crucifix out of his house will return
from the dead.”

Power and Privilege
Authority in the colonial world was divided between the
Crown and its state bureaucracy, both in Europe and the
Americas. In the first place, in New Spain power and
privilege was exerted through the indigenous hierarchy,
80which – unlike most of America north of New Spain –
retained aspects of its interconnected town, labor, kinship,
and cultural networks. Secondly, in both America and
Europe, the Crown vied for absolute control over the realm
with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. As Holy Roman
Emperor, Charles V and succeeding Hapsburg monarchs
were in a perennial tug- of-war with ecclesiastical
authorities at all levels of the clerical hierarchy.
The Catholic Church represented the second arm of
Spanish authority, overlapping and interpenetrating with
the state. Priests, as bearers of Christianity, as scribes,
notaries, executors of Church authority, and as both
advocates for the poor and oppressors of Indians,
accompanied every step of the early conquest, settlement,
and organization of the imperial project. No colonial
village was without a Catholic church, often a huge,
cathedral-like structure with elaborate statuary bathed in
gold leaf, looming over a collection of modest adobe
houses and commercial structures. The Church ministered
to the Indians and carried out its part of the “bargain” set
down by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors: the
Indians were to provide labor, tribute, and taxes in return
for receiving the “one true faith” – Catholicism. As Indian
slavery gave way to debt peonage, some of the
requirements were lifted, but Indians in towns and those in
their own villages were rarely free of the colonists’
demands.
The role of the Church in colonial Spain and Portugal has
been widely debated. No doubt the debate stems from the
fact that the Church, through its many layers of clergy,
nuns, and hierarchy, was never one thing for all places and
81people. Some of the clergy served as parish priests, called
“regular” clergy, administering sacraments to the
indigenous, mixed race, African slave, and free people of
color, as well as those of European descent. Another
group, called “secular” clergy, belonged to monastic orders
(such as Dominicans, Franciscans, and Jesuits) that fitted
within a chain of command both within the broader church
hierarchy, as well as within their own orders. The Church’s
main instrument of regulation and authority, in Iberia as
well as in America, was the Holy Office of the Inquisition.
Although Indians legally were exempt from the rulings of
the Inquisition, the reach of the Holy Office into the life of
communities was extensive and served as the final arbiter
of moral standing.
Land
From the colonial period onward the ownership and
cultivation of land was the most important determinant of
wealth and status. The European concept of private
property ownership, as opposed to communal use and
possession, was a concept foreign to the worldview of the
native peoples of the American continent. The significance
of land as a commodity increased as more settlers arrived
from Europe. In writing about the conquest and settlement
of North and South America, historian Michael Rogin
remarks: “Land was the major economic resource, the
major determinant of social status, and the major source of
political power in early America.”3 Landownership,
therefore, became the desire and goal of people from all
sectors of society, especially those seeking upward
mobility. In general those who received the earliest access
to land, either through tribute collection or outright land
82grants, came to be the owners of enormous plots, which in
turn furthered their economic advantage, since “regional
monopoly of good land and thus of local markets was an
effective way of limiting production and thus controlling
prices.” Owners of large tracts of land quickly became the
wealthiest people in a given community, dominating all
aspects of life through their influence on agriculture,
government, the Church, and the local economy. This was
the beginning of the system known in Latin America to
this day as latifundia, defined as large pieces of land,
usually worked by slaves or other unfree laborers.
Latifundia originated in ancient Rome and North Africa,
but today the term is only applied to landownership in
Latin America, and is used interchangeably with other
words for large estates: hacienda, estancia, fazenda.
In addition to latifundia, smaller parcels of land, known as
minifundia, were acquired by people of less importance,
particularly in the more remote regions of the empire. For
the Crown, which desired the vast frontier of newly
acquired territories to be physically settled to the greatest
extent possible, land became an incentive to move people
away from ports and cities and into the hinterlands. Unlike
their elite counterparts, small landowners often led
difficult lives, eking out a meager existence and taking
nearly half a century to accumulate the capital necessary to
pursue any type of mechanization or large-scale
production, or to buy slaves or equipment. Finally,
property ownership was not limited to entrepreneurial
laypeople. The Church, both individual clergy and
convents and monasteries, held title to large tracts of land,
and most notably in the case of the convents of Mexico
City and Lima, accrued fortunes, usually invested in
83property, made loans and collected rents. At one point in
the late sixteenth century, female-headed convents in Lima
were the largest property owners in the city.
Finally, indigenous communities maintained possession of
villages and the surrounding lands through grants obtained
from the Crown or the colonial authorities. The right of
Indians to work their lands, free from the infringement of
outsiders, came increasingly under threat as the number of
European settlers grew during the colonial period. The
right to land, and especially to the water needed to farm
the land, as well as the right of Indians to resist obligatory
labor on the neighboring estates, was a constant source of
litigation, strife, and war from the moment the first
colonists arrived in the New World. Indians found
themselves in need of money to pay for tools, seeds, and
other consumer goods and thus needed to enter into
commercial relations with the towns. Most importantly,
they came under the scrutiny of the Church, entering into
considerable debt to pay for baptisms, funerals, and other
requirements of the faith. It was nearly impossible for any
of the indigenous people of the Spanish empire to ignore
colonial institutions. Their villages and lives were poor and
on the margins; their livelihood ever more threatened with
each decade.
Many large landowners lived in opulent surroundings,
though their lifestyle has been exaggerated in the historical
imagination and the size of landholdings varied
immensely, as did the amount of wealth of each individual.
Landowners often spent little time in the rural areas over
which they held title, preferring instead to maintain a
household in a colonial city or town, and only occasionally
84visiting their estate to conduct business. Basic tasks in
regards to the land, therefore, were undertaken by others,
most commonly the plantation overseer, a person of lower
rank and often of mixed race, who interacted closely with
caciques and local colonial officials. Landowners
generally sought to live a noble life, as defined by
European aesthetics and values, surrounded by imported
luxury goods, eschewing manual labor. In general, only
those persons in the colonies who held some sort of title
from the Crown had special privileges, thus a major drive
existed to accrue them through service or achievement.
Successful enterprises, such as sugar mills (called
engenhos) in Brazil and agricultural plantations in Central
America, assured the wealth, prestige, and control over
society of early latifundistas. Over time it became more
possible for those who showed aptitude, talent, or
entrepreneurship in local bureaucracies to rise in status and
wealth, and eventually to acquire land.
Box 2.2 The dowry in colonial society
The mid-seventeenth-century dowry of Doña Lucía
de Pastene of Chile provides an example of the
extent to which great fortunes could be united
through the politics of marriage. Her dowry letter
to husband Maese de Campo Don Bernardo de
Amara Yturigoyen provided him with:
7,000 pesos in cash and the ranch of La Quillota
with 1,200 heads of cattle, 1,000 goats, 6,500
85sheep, and 12 pairs of oxen all of them valued at
18,190 pesos, without counting the value of the
land. The agricultural yield of La Quillota was
valued at 23,231 pesos per year. Doña Lucía’s
dowry also included several houses in Santiago de
Chile, which were valued at 8,300 pesos and
twenty-seven slaves whose price in the slave
market was 10,300 pesos. Doña Lucía brought also
as a part of the dowry silverware and silver luxury
objects with a combined weight of 277.12 kilos, a
personal wardrobe worthy of a queen, jewelry, a
collection of paintings by colonial artists, and
exquisite linens for beds and tables. If all the above
was not enough, Doña Lucía de Pastene owned a
small encomienda of twenty-five Indians which
also became part of the dowry transferred to Maese
de Campo Don Bernardo de Amara Yturigoyen.

Conquistadores: Women of the Viceroyalty of
Colonial Peru (Dallas, TX: Southern Methodist
University Press, 1989), p. 121.
Another important attribute of early Latin America, which
has come to define its societies into the present, is the
continuous consolidation and negotiation of power
relationships. According to historian Susan Ramírez in her
book The World Upside Down, power, prestige, and wealth
were concentrated in the ranks of the elite, leaving little
opportunity for anyone else to obtain a respectable and
86prosperous status. A system of land and wealth
consolidation quickly emerged amongst the elite in which
family played a major role, specifically through deaths and
marriages. Women were a crucial component of these
power relationships, since a widow could inherit a large
amount of land or wealth, which would then be perceived
as available to a male through marriage. Similarly,
daughters were often married into familial networks with
the goal of consolidating land and power. During the
colonial period a bride’s dowry served as a critical means
for the transference of wealth and property (see Box 2.2).
Wealthy families sought advantageous marriages for their
children to strengthen their prestige, increase their
fortunes, and protect their privileged position in society.
As a result, marriages often took place between the
relatively young daughters of elite families, with
sometimes significantly older men with whom parents
desired to establish ties for the mutual benefit of the
parties. The compadrazgo, or godparent-godchild
relationship, also represented an important means of
creating power relationships, as did the unions of distant –
and not-so-distant – relatives.
The major result of intricately planned intermarriages
among large landholding families and other people of
privilege was the solidification and furtherance of the
already emerging grip that elites held over early Latin
American society. Even in areas where smaller holdings
were more common, the most prominent members of
society flexed considerable muscle and exerted their
influence through kinship networks. This was the case in
the town of Nossa Senhora de Penha e França in 1765 in
the Brazilian state of São Paulo, where one figure, Manuel
87Dias Bueno, had family ties to the wealthiest one-third of
the entire population. Since it was not uncommon for a
powerful landowner to live in a city or town, influence was
often felt through the control of municipal governance
systems. In another case, the pervasiveness of landowners’
power can be seen in the actions of Don Juan Bonifacio de
Seña in Piura, who served at various points in his life in
late seventeenth-century Peru as captain of the militia,
governor of arms, general and field marshal, military
reviewer, lieutenant governor, and corregidor. In addition
to positions of authority, local bureaucracies came to be
filled with those having family connections to the
wealthiest figure in the region, creating a serious obstacle
for upward mobility among those who found themselves
outside his (or her) sphere. Many times, the reputation
surrounding certain elite families exaggerated their actual
financial prowess, and their mystique and celebrity
outlived their actual power over those around them.
Colonial Administration
If privilege, power, and ownership represented the key
elements in the formation of colonial society, the courts in
Spain and Portugal were correspondingly concerned that
the colonial elite not outstrip their counterparts in Europe
in wealth or power over their underlings. To ensure
subservience, the Crown dispatched a retinue of governors,
viceroys, royal accountants, notaries, civil servants, and
the full bureaucratic hierarchy of Catholic officialdom to
the New World. While daring and ruthless soldiers, men,
and a few women, of fortune claimed the land of the
Americas for themselves in the name of the Spanish
monarchs, it was left to the dispassionate calculations of
88Crown and Church officials to regulate, administer,
convert, and police the American holdings. These
Spaniards and their family members who were born in
Europe were called peninsulares. Their positions, and their
loyalties, were tied to the enforcement of customs and
rules from the Old World.
The Crown’s administrative arm was the Council of Indies
and the two bodies that served as primary regulators: the
Consulado or Merchant’s Guild, and the Casa de
Contratación or Board of Trade. Established in 1524 by
Charles I, the Madrid-based Council of Indies oversaw all
matters pertaining to taxation, administration, patronage,
and defense of the newly acquired lands. At the height of
its influence, in the mid- to late sixteenth century, the
Council served as the court of appeals for civil cases,
arranged judicial reviews, censored books and reading
materials, and issued the final stamp of approval on papal
decrees. The close cooperation of the two institutions
ensured for the Crown a monopoly of trade with America,
as well as its colonies in Asia. The Consulado of Seville,
an extension of the medieval guilds established throughout
Spain, oversaw the fleets of ships that carried wealth from
the colonies to the Spanish coffers. Consulados in Peru
and Mexico funneled trade from the mineral-rich colonies
through few hands, in hopes of holding the lion’s share of
the royal tithe, or share, intact. Peru and Mexico
effectively controlled the licensure of many merchants in
the Americas, ensuring maximum oversight for the Crown
through its closely guarded coterie of merchant houses and
families based in Lima and Mexico City. These guilds
guaranteed the exclusive domain of the Crown over all
trading relationships, including licensing all those engaged
89in the colonial trade, issuing contracts, authorizing
insurance policies, and arbitrating disputed bankruptcy
proceedings.
The Casa de Contratación (known as the Casa), the other
arm of the Council of the Indies, oversaw every detail of
the colonial monopoly, including purchases, warehouses,
transportation, and routing, and served as the official
registrant of the merchants, importers and exporters. The
Casa sat in Seville and was eventually subsumed under the
Council of Indies, with its authority centered on trade as
opposed to the other political duties of the Council. One of
its key functions was the collection and enforcement of
taxes as an aspect of the imperial monopoly. Emblematic
of the royal bureaucracy, the Casa was obsessed with
finding contraband, and since official position offered
anyone easy access, the Casa ended up arbitrarily
repressing and profiting from the vast contraband networks
that seemed to sprout directly from the very system of
rigid controls the Hapsburg throne sought to enforce for
almost three centuries.
By the end of the eighteenth century, charges of corruption
hampered the entire Council of Indies bureaucracy, leading
to one of the key organizational changes instituted by the
Bourbon monarchy, when the Hapsburg line came to an
end in 1700. Administratively, the colonial monopoly had
functioned through a system of designated ports in Iberia
and America, servicing designated ships, owned or
managed by designated individuals and companies trading
designated goods, including a very extensive trade in
slaves from Africa. It was the fate of such a tightly
controlled system to eventually break down, despite
90assiduous efforts on the part of many state functionaries
and the Holy Office of the Inquisition, whose role in
intercepting and censoring “blasphemous” materials
extended to confiscation of reading materials that touched
on issues contrary to dogmatic Catholicism and strict
adherence to the rule of the Crown. Faced with ineptitude
at home, smuggling abroad, piracy on the high seas, and
cheating throughout, the poorly managed Hapsburg
monarchy fell into increasing crisis as the empire proved
more and more unwieldy. When in 1700 the Hapsburg line
came to an end and the Spanish throne was turned over to
the French-based House of Bourbon, a new era of
“enlightened despotism” dictated a change in course.
Enlightened Monarchy
During the eighteenth century a number of European
monarchs selectively embraced some aspects of
Enlightenment philosophy. The Enlightenment was a set of
ideas that swept European intellectual circles and
eventually the colonies. This movement called for the
defeat of superstition and the triumph of reason and
rationality in the realm of politics, economics, and
scholarship. The monarchies, however, did not embrace
the ultimate in enlightened rationality – an end to their
own inherited rule – thus the term for this system of
authority is “enlightened monarchy” or “enlightened
despotism.” They were still absolute monarchs, or despots,
but they hoped to maintain their power by adopting some
features of capitalist rationality. The Bourbons focused
largely on a more rational administration of trade with the
colonies and a streamlining of the royal bureaucracy.
91From 1759 until 1808 they embarked on a series of
innovations and reforms to transform colonial policy,
revolving around several key measures, including
reorganizing the political administration to replace
unwieldy viceroyalties with smaller “intendancies.” The
new Intendant functioned more as a governor than as an
arm of the king. Second, in an effort to undermine rampant
smuggling in unsanctioned ports – notably Buenos Aires,
which had grown and prospered as a key conduit for
contraband entering the colonies – more ports were opened
to trade and more merchants were brought into the
monopoly. It wasn’t exactly “free trade” as some were
beginning to demand, but it was a step away from the
stranglehold of the royal merchant guilds. Thus, under
pressure from a growing population of colonial traders, the
Bourbon monarchy opened consulados in Manila, Buenos
Aires, Caracas, Cartagena, Guadalajara, Guatemala,
Havana, Santiago de Chile, and Veracruz, while informal,
smaller guilds that essentially functioned as
mini-consulados were founded in Montevideo and San
Juan, Puerto Rico. Eventually, as a part of the Bourbon
Reforms, the Board of Trade was eliminated in the late
eighteenth century; a few decades later, when
independence was won from Spain, the entire colonial
network was dismantled. The monarchy’s need to raise
revenue was behind the third reform: an elaborate system
of taxes, raising the sales tax (alcabala); imposing new
taxes on rum and pulque (the common alcoholic beverage
of the peasantry and townsfolk); and generally tightening
both the tax collection system in the colonies and the
transference of riches from America to the Iberian
peninsula. A fourth measure opened more ports in Spain to
colonial trade, previously the monopoly of Seville,
92effectively destroying the Andalusian aristocracy’s grip on
trade with the New World.
Finally, although not exactly a part of the economic and
political package, the Jesuits were expelled from the
Americas (and much of Europe). This tightly structured
and industrious order of priests had established hospitals,
universities, and missions throughout Latin America, and
because of their efficient organization, sometimes harsh
use of Indian labor, and contacts with the sons of the
Creole elite in the universities, had gained what their
enemies considered to be undue influence and prestige.
The Jesuits were expelled from the lands under Portuguese
control in 1759 and in 1767 from Spanish America. Their
“crimes” against the Iberian crowns illustrate the link
between Church and state, and the presence of the Church
on many sides of ideological debates of the era, including
Indian slavery, the free expression of new ideas, success in
commerce and land management. The elite on both sides
of the Atlantic perceived Jesuit positions on these issues as
a threat.
In a host of ways, the Bourbon Reforms (like the
eighteenth-century enforcement of the Navigation Acts in
British North America) were intended to reclaim the
empire. Effective but hated, the reforms produced mixed
results. For a while they did allow for the reconquest of the
empire, but in the long run they introduced new views on
commerce, politics, and philosophy to such an extent that
more and more members of the Latin American elite began
to ponder the possibility of independence from Spain.
After 1788 and the successful rebellion of the northern
American colonies against England, followed by the
93French Revolution of 1789, the landowners and merchants
of South America debated the consequences of following
in the path of their northern neighbors. When they took
action, the fervor passed through both Spanish and
Portuguese America.
The Agents of the Reform
It bears remembering that although momentous social and
political forces were afoot in the mid- to late eighteenth
century, a number of key figures pushed particular agendas
and were responsible for bringing about dramatic changes.
José Gálvez (1720–87) who became Spain’s minister of
the Indies in January 1776, cast a long shadow over the
Bourbon program. On the Portuguese side, reforms were
the work of the Marquês de Pombal (1699–1782). These
two men profoundly influenced the contours of the reform
era both on the Iberian Peninsula and in the colonial world.
No official’s personal imprint on the reform era was more
obvious than that of José de Gálvez. He arrived in Mexico
in 1765 on a visita (official visit) as the monarch’s
representative, sent to inspect the management of the
Crown’s affairs and sit in judgment at hearings on
grievances brought against colonial authorities by citizens
of all ranks, even very lowly ones. Bearing the ominous
title of Inspector-General, Gálvez found the viceroyalty in
disarray. He proceeded to reorganize the system of tax
collection, consolidate mercantile affairs in the hands of
loyal Spanish merchants, imprison corrupt tax officials,
and centralize more of the economy in mining enterprises.
Intent on bettering relations between the colony and Spain,
Gálvez moved decisively and swiftly to isolate
94troublemakers, especially the independent-thinking Jesuits
whose intellectual and entrepreneurial ventures had long
aggravated the Holy Office of the Inquisition and other
arbiters of religious and political conformity.
After a bout of poor health, Gálvez returned to Spain in
1771, took up a seat on the Council of Indies and within a
few years assumed its top position. In this capacity, as the
most powerful figure in the realm apart from the monarch
(some would say including the monarch), Gálvez spread
throughout the Americas the reforms initiated in Mexico,
especially collecting taxes, weeding out graft, and
repressing smuggling. In response to this tightening of the
colonial hold, there were revolts, the most famous of
which were the Comunero Revolt in New Granada in 1781
and the rebellion of Túpac Amaru II in Peru in 1780–1.
Both were met with intense repression, as Gálvez’s
strategy was to brook no opposition to his tight-fisted rule.
He remained actively involved in administering the realm
until his death in 1787.
As minister to the Portuguese Crown the Marquês de
Pombal instituted what came to be known as the
Pombaline Reforms in much the same way as had Gálvez
in Spain. In the mid-eighteenth century Pombal determined
to consolidate Portugal’s holdings and promote settlements
throughout the vast Brazilian territory. He encouraged
intermarriage between whites and Indians by rewarding
white men with access to office for marrying Indian
women. Similar to the formation of the intendancies in
Spanish America, Pombal formed “captaincies” in Brazil,
solidified the oversight of tax collection, regulated the
inspection of goods coming in and out of the ports, and
95reinforced the dominance of the Portuguese Board of
Trade, or Junta da Fazenda. The capital of Brazil was
moved from Salvador, in the northeast, to Rio de Janeiro in
the southeast. Pombal’s role in expelling the Jesuits
angered the Church, as well as his support for secularizing
the court system and basing legal judgments on national
laws, as opposed to canon or church laws and regulations.
Similar to Spanish America, when the Portuguese Crown
expelled the Jesuits, Indians were ejected from mission
lands and became prey to local slave catchers and
mercenaries in the employ of landowners.
Fundamentally, Pombal and Gálvez were instruments of
Enlightenment monarchy, a peculiar blend of
eighteenth-century secular freedom and despotism. Both
figures sought to reclaim for the central authority in the
homeland stricter control over management of the empire’s
political and economic affairs. Not surprisingly, both of
these far-reaching reformers were operating at a time when
the French and the English monarchies were concerned
with revolutionary uprisings at home, in the case of
France, or in its North American colonies, in the case of
England. Bourbon and Pombaline reforms were the first
stage of a defensive action intent on eliminating the worst
excesses of monarchical rule, while preserving the core of
feudal military and political power. Furthermore, both of
these powerful administrators were emblematic of the
transitional nature of the times in which they were living.
They each came from modest families of the lower gentry
and rose to positions of unparalleled influence in
government and society. Both were efficient managers and
became powerful despite their modest origins because they
seized on new methods of rule at a time when the old order
96was in crisis. Neither leader had the backing of the Church,
and indeed each bucked it; neither relied on royal
favoritism, nor did either rise through the ranks of the
military or by bravery in the field of battle or conquest, the
most common road to upward mobility for the lesser
nobility. They were, oddly enough, secular, entrepreneurial
and nascent administrators whose purpose was to secure
the continuance of the monarchies they served. They each
died within a decade of the French Revolution (1789), an
event that would irrevocably change the political future of
Spain and Portugal, of all of Europe, and of imperial rule.
History records them as transitional figures that used, and
refashioned, the rules of the old feudal order to govern
more efficiently an empire forced to come to terms with
the advance of merchant capitalism.
Disorder and Rebellion
As the eighteenth century drew to a close, administrators
and ruling elites at home and in the colonies confronted
civil disorder involving a wide range of social classes, led
often by non-elite Creoles and supported by men and
women from the growing urban and rural working classes.
Historian Stuart Voss comments that the most remarkable
change of the mid-eighteenth century was the appearance
of “civil disorder whose participants were from different
social strata.”4 Throughout the colonial world, especially
in market towns and port cities, the rigid rules of the royal
bureaucracy strained under pressure from increasingly
nationalist Creoles. Resistance and rebellion erupted on
many fronts, including shopkeepers and merchants who
felt cut out of the colonial monopoly, an expanding group
of mid-level bureaucrats, teachers, professionals, small
97landowners, and low-ranking clergy, all of whom chafed
against the stultifying regulations and capricious
enforcement of the weighty royal bureaucracy. New
groups whose voices had been silent during the colonial
era, at least on the national stage, began to mobilize:
women, Indians, urban workers, artisans, slaves, and
others dispossessed of land and money.
A string of uprisings punctuated the Andean region in the
eighteenth century. In all, 128 rebellions took place,
beginning in 1730 and culminating in “The Great Andean
Rebellion” of the 1780s. Led by Túpac Amaru II, the Inca
name for José Gabriel Condoracanqui (1738–81),
thousands of indigenous and mixed-race Andeans
demonstrated, destroyed property, and entered into combat
against colonial officials in the cities and countryside of
Peru and Bolivia for over a year. Taking the name of the
last Inca ruler (executed by the Spanish in the late
sixteenth century), Túpac Amaru II began in 1780 to lead
an uprising of the indigenous people of what is today Peru
and Bolivia. His forces attacked Cuzco from January 2 to
9, 1781, but the Spanish military proved too strong for his
army of 40,000–60,000 followers. After being repelled
from the capital of the ancient Inca empire and intellectual
hub of colonial Peru, the insurgents marched around the
countryside galvanizing forces. In April Túpac Amaru was
captured, taken to Cuzco, and executed the following
month, but not before being forced to watch the torture and
execution of his wife and family members. Another
member of the insurgent force, Túpac Katarí (similarly
adopting an Indian name) led a siege of La Paz, Bolivia, in
November, but was eventually betrayed and captured. Both
Túpac Amaru II and Túpac Katarí were executed by
98having their extremities tied to four horses driven in
different directions, ripping their bodies asunder (Figure
2.1). The remains were left posted on the outskirts of the
respective cities as a warning of the consequences of
opposing Spanish rule.
A second rebellion shook the area of New Granada
(present-day Colombia) that same year. Called the Revolt
of the Comuneros, this rebellion erupted in opposition to
the increased sales tax (alcabala). The disturbance began
on March 16, 1781 in Socorro when town residents came
together to protest a new tax imposed by the very
unpopular Visitador Juan Francisco Gutiérrez de Piñeres.
Along with a reduction in the alcabala, citizens demanded
an end to a series of other measures including higher head
taxes, new restrictions on tobacco cultivation, abuses of
the liquor monopoly, and an excessive concentration of
public revenue expenditures in the capital city of Bogotá,
to the detriment of smaller, regional municipalities, such as
Socorro. Although the majority of participants were
mestizos, complaints against the treatment of blacks and
Indians also figured in the insurgents’ demands.

99The act that sparked the initial protest and led to the much
larger Comunero Revolt over the succeeding weeks was
carried out by Manuela Beltrán (1724–?), a young woman
of ordinary background who stepped forward to rip the
hated tax decree from the wall on which it was posted.
Whether Beltrán continued as a leader of the
demonstration is unclear. Her name all but disappears from
the account, probably for reasons of her gender and social
class. According to one of the only reports of this
demonstration to survive, Captain Juan Francisco Berbeo
(1729–95), a local military officer, stepped into the
leadership role at the head of the crowd. The
demonstration gained strength in its march from Socorro to
Bogotá to the point that a reported 20,000 women and men
descended on the outskirts of the colonial capital,
demanding a meeting with local officials. Indicative of the
fear that this hitherto rare demonstration evoked, the
colonial Visitador went into hiding and left the
negotiations to Archbishop Caballero y Góngora
(1723–96). Assuming the role of intermediary, the bishop
negotiated an agreement that met a portion of the
comuneros’ demands. As the crowds dispersed for home,
the Archbishop and colonial officers reneged on the accord
and ordered the military to pursue and apprehend the
100insurgents. In subsequent months trials and executions
decimated the movement and terrorized the rank and file
with public executions of some of the leading figures.
However, Captain Berbeo and his co-conspirators from the
elite were granted amnesty and returned to their previous
positions in society. Under the leadership of a small
farmer, José Antonio Galán, a small band of protesters
continued to attack government installations for another
year. With their capture and execution in early 1782 the
revolt came to an end, and for decades remained largely
unknown to anyone outside the immediate region.
Scant research into the uprising has left many unanswered
questions, specifically pertaining to the identity of those
involved and precisely what they intended to do in Bogotá.
Some historians have argued that the Comunero Revolt
was an opening salvo in the independence movement that
swept the continent during the early decades of the
nineteenth century, while others view it as an isolated
protest against Bourbon taxation policies. Viewed with the
benefit of hindsight, it seems that the actions of the
comuneros portended a growing willingness on the part of
previously silent social actors to demonstrate their
rejection of certain aspects of colonial rule. It began in the
provinces, swept through the countryside to the capital,
involved participants from across the spectrum of social
class, gender, and age, and drew in members from both
military and civilian ranks.
Discontent and Disorder in Brazil
Similar to Spanish America, in the early 1790s
conspiracies and plots against the Portuguese colonial
101government erupted in Brazil. In the prosperous mining
area of Minas Gerais a local dentist, Joaquim José da Silva
Xavier (1746–92), who went by the nickname Tiradentes
(“tooth-puller”), conspired with a number of wealthy
miners to sever ties with the Portuguese government.
When the mines had turned a handsome profit for colonial
miners in the early eighteenth century, they had been
content to accept the protection and benefits of the
Portuguese Crown. Discontent arose in tandem with the
exhaustion of the mines. In the face of a diminishing
supply of gold and gems, colonists grew angry that the
Crown refused to reduce the tithe it demanded or lighten
the tax burden on miners. The conspirators met in secret
and hatched a plan to declare Minas Gerais independent,
their audacity based on the assumption that the other states
would follow their lead and likewise declare independence
from Portugal. The plan was scuttled when an agent in
their midst revealed the plot to the authorities, who
captured Tiradentes who had fled to Rio de Janeiro. His
decapitated head was returned to the wealthy mining city
of Vila Rica (today Ouro Preto) and left to decompose on a
post in the main square as a formidable deterrent to others
discontented with the Crown’s policies.
Six years later in Salvador da Bahia, northeast Brazil’s
most important city, the Tailors’ Conspiracy
(Inconfidência de Alfaiates) convulsed the city. In this
case, educated members of the colonial elite – influenced
by principles of the Enlightenment and the outbreak of
successful revolutions and independence movements
abroad, and fueled by grievances against the Pombaline
reforms – along with mixed-race artisans, conspired to
overthrow the government and institute free trade and a
102new independent state. Similar to revolts in Colombia,
Peru, and Minas Gerais, the cross-class, multiracial
composition of the conspirators divided along class and
racial lines on the goals of the uprising. Poor whites, freed
persons, slaves, mixed-race artisans, and a few radical
upperclass whites wanted to abolish slavery, curb the
power of the Catholic Church, end all forms of racial
oppression, and establish a government that provided
opportunity for all citizens. Their plan was borrowed from
the most radical precepts of the French Revolution, which
by the 1790s was setting the standard for revolutionary
rhetoric throughout much of the colonial world.
When the royal authorities discovered the plot, they moved
to jail and execute the conspirators. Similar to the outcome
of conspiracies in neighboring states or distant lands, the
most severe punishments, including execution, torture,
banishment, and long jail sentences, were meted out to
poor whites, working people of color, and slaves. Among
the white elite, the radicals who joined the Tailors’
Conspiracy were influenced by the revolutionary ideals
rocking France at this time, whereas those equally
discontented with colonial policies, but wary of the power
of the lower classes, held back, either refusing to get
involved or condemning the conspirators as a threat to the
social order. The plot and resultant repression
demonstrates the divergent goals that previously silent
social groups were bringing to the foreground, and the
importance of class position in determining the depth of
commitment of individual insurgents.
Changing Gender Roles
103Women from all social classes broke into the public arena
on many levels: politically, economically, and culturally.
By the mid-eighteenth century, and continuing into the
nineteenth, women were increasingly participating in the
workforce, particularly in the production of cotton cloth
and as market traders. In many major textile production
centers, such as Querétaro (Mexico) and Cochabamba
(Bolivia) and parts of the Chaco in La Plata (Argentina),
women were the mainstay of the production process, as
was also the case in tobacco sales and cigar making in
Cuba and other areas of the Caribbean. The Bourbon
Reformers extolled the importance of women, even
middle-class “respectable” women, as laborers because of
their diligent work habits, especially in arduous and
repetitive tasks, which were needed to bolster the lagging
economy. As a result of their heightened role in the
economic life of the colonies, women were angered along
with men – their husbands, brothers, sons, and fathers – at
the imposition of new and higher taxes, especially sales
taxes that increased the price of necessary household
goods. Also, their role as sellers in the marketplace
brought many women into direct conflict with restrictive
aspects of the Reforms.
Women were a major presence in the Túpac Amaru II
revolt in 1780–1. As historian Sonya Lipsett-Rivera notes,
the revolt that had begun as a protest against the Bourbon
Reforms soon mushroomed into a general rebellion against
the colonial government’s racist treatment of the
indigenous people of the Andean region. “Women, as
much as men, were affected by these injustices.”5 Túpac
Amaru II’s wife, Micaela Bastidas, commanded a battalion
of insurgents and was responsible for the uprising in the
104San Felipe de Tungasucan region. She is often credited
with being a superior strategist to Túpac Amaru II, and
certainly more daring. Apparently she chided her husband
at one point for his timidity and refusal to mount a surprise
attack against the Spaniards in Cuzco to catch the weakly
fortified city off guard. Instead Túpac Amaru II wasted
precious time encircling the countryside in hopes of
building up his army. By the time the insurgents attacked
the city, the Spaniards had brought in reinforcements and
were able to quell the uprising. Túpac Amaru II, Micaela
Bastidas, and many others were captured and the rebels
dispersed.
At one stage in the rebellion the Quechua speakers, under
Túpac Amaru’s command, fought together with
Aymara-speaking rebels from Puno on Lake Titicaca and
on the Bolivian side of the lake. The alliance did not last,
however, and the Aymara leader, Túpac Katarí (ca.
1750–81) led his forces alone until his capture in October
1781. His female commander and partner Bartola Sisa
continued the resistance, leading a contingent of 2,000
troops for a number of months. Eventually, in early 1782,
the Spanish army defeated the rebels in Peru and Bolivia.
According to contemporary sources, colonial officials were
shocked to find that of the 73 leaders, 32 were women, all
of whom were executed, although not publicly.
Manuela Beltrán in the Comunero Revolt, and Micaela
Bastidas and Bartola Sisa in the Andean insurgency were
some of the more famous of a large group of women who
took part in public demonstrations against high prices,
poor food distribution networks to outlying areas, racist
treatment of Indian people, mounting taxes and
105ever-tightening controls on day-to-day life in the colonies.
Nonetheless, the march of the women of Socorro drew
enough recognition that the great liberator of Spanish
America, Simón Bolívar, commemorated the event with a
speech in 1820 known as the “Address to the Ladies
[Matronas] of Socorro,” which was publicly proclaimed in
February of that year. The address refers to the women in
relationship with their families, their husbands and
children, thus seeing them as mothers, wives, and
daughters, yet at the same time associates them with power
and heroism. Bolivar’s address to “the Illustrious Ladies of
Socorro” as “virile women” whom no human power “is
capable of subjugating,” was a reference that he no doubt
hoped would shame the men into likewise defying Spanish
officials. Comparing the bravery of the women of Socorro
against the Spanish colonial army, he declared:
Heroic ladies of Socorro: the mothers of Sparta did not ask
for their children’s lives, but for the victory of their
country; the mothers of Rome contemplated with pleasure
the glorious wounds of their family; they encouraged them
to achieve the honour of dying in combat. More sublime
are you in your generous patriotism, you have wielded the
lance, you have taken up position in the columns and you
ask to die for the homeland. Mothers, wives, sisters, who
could follow your steps in the race towards heroism? Are
there men worthy of you? No, no, no! But you are worth
the admiration of the Universe and the adoration of the
liberators of Colombia.6
To be sure, most women who participated in the rebellions
received little notice; yet many were active in village
uprisings in the waves of protest that preceded the
106outbreak of independence in the nineteenth century. This
militancy among women of the working and peasant
classes coincided with the first cracks in the patriarchal
system that restricted life for women of all social strata.
On the Road to Independence
The eighteenth century ended with the tug-of-war between
the dictates of the reorganized Bourbon and Pombaline
leadership and a growing colonial opposition. Whereas
Enlightenment philosophy was infusing debates over
whether the European Crowns had the right to rule the
colonies in America, militant voices began to question the
right of any monarchy to rule any populace, at home or
abroad. Radicals debated moderates, pro-monarchy
conservatives confronted militant republicans, anti-slavery
forces denounced slavery and the parasitical landowning
system it supported. Yet, despite sporadic regional
conspiracies no Latin American or Caribbean country
actively moved to take up independence until the last days
of the eighteenth century, following the slave uprising in
the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue.
Nonetheless, strains of republicanism and calls for
universal brotherhood and equality had begun to filter into
the salons, cafes, street conversations, newspapers,
pamphlets, and books in Latin American and Caribbean
capitals and port cities.
The call for freedom, however, would not resonate in all
ears in the same way. Longstanding servile peasants,
castas, slaves, and oppressed people of color were not a
part of the discussion among the Creole landowning,
merchant, and planter elite. The latter envisioned freedom
107for themselves, but not for those who served them. The
masses, on the other hand, saw no reason to give up their
lives for freedom unless they were guaranteed a stake in
the independent new society.
Nationalism and American Culture
The eighteenth century saw the flowering of intellectual
currents that fused Creole and indigenous Latin American
culture, such as Cuzqueño (originating in the city of
Cuzco) painting in Peru and mestizo art and literature in
Mexico. From the earliest encounter between the
indigenous people of the continent and the European
interlopers – or, it could be argued, from the first moments
in which Spaniards enslaved the conquered natives to help
in the destruction of their own art, drama, and architectural
forms so as to replace them with European forms –
indigenous and mestizo cultural expression struggled to
survive. Even in the midst of Spanish and Catholic
orthodoxy that sought to eliminate, or at least sublimate,
indigenous artistry, native expression persevered, and even
coexisted, in colonial society. At the end of the eighteenth
century trends shifted and mestizo culture emerged as a
source of pride, even as a nascent home-grown
philosophical justification for Latin American autonomy.
One of the key expressions of mestizo art became
synonymous with the Peruvian city of Cuzco, which for a
hundred years before the arrival of the Spaniards had
served as the capital of the vast Inca empire. Nestled in the
highlands, this religious and political center of both Incan
and Spanish culture still bears a bit of spectacular Inca
architecture in walls and palaces. One of the most
108intriguing early examples of mestizo architecture can be
seen in Coricancha, an Inca palace around which the
Dominican order of priests built a monastery, utilizing
some of the precisely cut Inca stone walls for both exterior
and interior supports. Remarkably, whereas the part of the
monastery the Spaniards constructed has been destroyed
and rebuilt several times after devastating earthquakes, the
Inca walls remain intact.

Zapata. (Courtesy South American Pictures)
Under the Spaniards Cuzco was transformed into a
dazzling baroque city of churches and colorful colonial
streets, while indigenous art maintained a lively presence
beneath the surface. Beginning in the seventeenth century,
and reaching its apex in the eighteenth, Spanish and
indigenous art came together in a form that splendidly
109fused both cultures. A prime example of mestizo art, the
Cuzqueño school was made up of a group of artists led by
the Indian painters Diego Quispe Tito in the seventeenth
century and Marcos Zapata in the mid- to late eighteenth
century.These indigenous artists developed workshops that
trained artisans, painters, and sculptors to produce
paintings, altar pieces, and many religious and secular
artifacts that displayed a harmonious blend of indigenous
and European symbols. One of the most famous is the
“Last Supper” that hangs in the Cathedral in Cuzco, which
depicts cooked guinea pigs (an Andean staple) on the table
for the consumption of Christ and the apostles (Figure 2.2).
In Mexico Creole nationalists appropriated and
reconfigured for the broader society symbols that had
previously belonged only to Spain. The famous legend of
the appearance of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego, an
Indian peasant boy, at Tepeyac on the outskirts of Mexico
City became the prime symbol of Mexican, mestizo, and
Indian nationalism. According to the well-known legend,
the Virgin directed the boy to tell the bishop to build a
church on the site of her appearance. When the bishop
doubted the boy, more for his station in life than from
disbelief in miracles, the Virgin left her image on a cloth
for the boy to take to the bishop as proof of her request.
The story was first popularized in the mid-seventeenth
century, over a hundred years after it supposedly occurred,
and the image of the Virgin is both dark and Indian in its
features, signifying her indigenous roots and power in the
face of European Catholicism (see Box 2.3). If, ardent
Creole nationalists observed, Mary was indigenous to
Mexico, then why did the Mexicans need the Spanish?
Centuries later thousands of devout followers continue to
110worship at the vast, ultramodern cathedral that stands
alongside the small original sixteenth-century church, now
subsumed into the sprawling environs of Mexico City,
while the Virgin’s image graces T-shirts, tattoos,
rock-and-roll concert posters, and other paraphernalia of
the secular world as a symbol of Mexican pride.
Similarly, the appearance of the myth of Quetzalcoatl in an
era when Mexicans were beginning to chafe under Spanish
rule was no accident, and lent force once again to the
assertion that Mexico did not need to depend on a distant
colonial power for cultural inspiration. The myth of
Quetzalcoatl, the pacificist god of the Toltecs for whom,
according to legend, the Aztecs mistook Hernán Cortés,
actually entered Mexican mythology in the eighteenth
century. If, as the priests had argued, the key virtue the
Spaniards had brought to the Indians was Christian
salvation and the replacement of the angry god of human
sacrifice (Huitzilopoctli) with the benign god of Christian
forgiveness (Jesus Christ), then the very fact that the
Indians had a god of forgiveness in the person of
Quetzalcoatl long before the Spaniards arrived made their
Christ of little or no relevance to the salvation of Indian
souls. One particularly bizarre twist on the returning god
legend was the idea that Quetzalcoatl had actually been a
Christian god, if not Jesus Christ himself. According to
this logic, the native peoples of America were not indebted
to the Spaniards for their faith; rather, the entire process of
conversion had actually gone in the other direction.
According to this version, Quetzalcoatl was banished from
Mexico for his pacifist teachings, somehow ending up in
Europe, and then returned with the Spaniards to rekindle
Christianity in the land of its origins: Mexico! The logic
111was that if Europeans could not be credited with ending
human sacrifice and bringing Christianity, then their
intervention had brought nothing but destruction: disease,
malnutrition, overwork, mass death, cultural and political
devastation.
In Brazil the cultural, artistic, and intellectual seeds of a
nationalist separatist identity proceeded more haltingly
than in Spanish America. The preponderance of slavery
and its penetration through all aspects of Brazilian society
(see Chapter 3) produced an Afro-Brazilian culture,
apparent in religion, in dress, food, language, and art.
Since slavery was everywhere in Brazil, and slaves
performed every type of work, the imprint of Africa on
Brazil was profound. African rituals, kept alive in slave
quarters, permeated white society as well, while the
considerable population of mulattos served as cultural
transmission belts from African to Portuguese culture.
African religions such as candomblé dominated the slave
quarters, and found an occasional audience in the Big
House as well, while Catholicism remained the official
religion. Elements of African cuisine appeared on the table
of the masters; tales of Africa resonated through the slave
quarters; the rhythm of the drums, the single-stringed
berimbau, along with language and folk tales from the
African homeland, infused Brazilian music. Unlike
Spanish America, however, the overwhelming dependence
on slavery, and the demographic predominance of people
of African descent, served as a brake on pro-independence
sentiments among the planters and merchant Creoles. The
gradual, almost laconic, fusion of European and African
cultures did not herald a dismissal of Portuguese political
dominance. At the end of the eighteenth century Brazilians
112thought, looked, talked, and acted in ways dramatically
different from the Portuguese. However, cultural
confrontations remained in-house expressions of
master–slave relations, as opposed to the
Creole-Peninsular conflict more typical of Spanish
America.
Box 2.3 The Virgin of Guadalupe
The Virgin of Guadalupe ( Figure 2.3) is not only a
popular icon in Mexican history, art, and literature,
but plays a crucial role in the daily lives of the
Mexican people, both at home and in the diaspora.
In the words of Mexican Nobel Laureate Octavio
Paz, the “Virgin is the consolation of the poor, the
shield of the weak, the help of the oppressed. In
sum, she is the Mother of orphans. All men are
born disinherited and their true condition is
orphanhood, but this is particularly true among the
Indians and the poor in Mexico.”7
Made famous by Father Miguel Hidalgo when he
carried her image into battle at the outbreak of the
independence struggle in 1808, the Virgin has
evolved over the centuries from a symbol of
resistance against Spanish oppression to an icon of
rebelliousness in general. In the 1970s César
Chávez, the main spokesperson for the United
Farm Workers, an organization overwhelmingly
composed of Mexican-Americans in California and
113the Southwest, carried a banner with the union’s
crest alongside an image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe as he and others fought for basic
economic and political rights for migrant farm
workers. Likewise, during the 1960s and 1970s
Mexican-American student organizations displayed
the Virgin on posters and banners at
demonstrations as both a symbol of Chicano power
and the emblem of their mixed identity.
Figure 2.3 The Virgin of Guadalupe, a
sixteenth-century Katsam painting of unknown
provenance, resides in the Cathedral of the Virgin
of Guadalupe in Mexico City.
114Figure 2.4 “Portrait of the Artist as the Virgin of
Guadalupe” by Yolanda López (permission of
artist; image courtesy Special Collections,
Davidson Library, UCSB).
115The Virgin’s appearance in present-day pop culture
reflects the switch from a sacred religious image in
Mexico to a global popular culture icon, especially
among Mexican-Americans. She graces the drum
set of the Chicano rock band Los Lobos, but
surfaces in more unlikely venues as well. For
example, in the 1970s the Chicana feminist artist
Yolanda López painted the Virgin as an active,
contemporary woman in athletic running gear,
symbolic of the liberated Mexican-American
(Figure 2.4). As explained by Mexican writer
Guillermo Gómez-Peña, feminists, gang members,
116political activists, and a slew of irreverent outcasts
embraced the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe as
a way of creating something new: “They had
reappropriated it, reactivated it, recontextualized it,
and turned it into a symbol of resistance... no
longer the contemplative mestiza Mother of all
Mexicans, but a warrior goddess who blessed the
cultural and political weapons of activists and
artists.”8
Conclusion
The sweep of events from the moment the Spanish and
Portuguese arrived in what they erroneously called a “New
World” moved from conquest to management. The Iberian
monarchs oversaw an extensive bureaucracy that stretched
from ports in Europe into the far reaches of the American
colonies. From the onset, the seeds of rebellion and
separation from the ways of the “Old World” were
apparent.
The strains of Creole nationalism that permeated empires
in the eighteenth century had in common a demonstrated
fusion of European, native indigenous, and African
cultures, essentially transposing one iconography for
another and thus, in turn, planting the seeds of a new
“American” sensibility. Creole, mestizo, indigenous, and
African intellectual and cultural expression foreshadowed
momentous political changes, and, notably, found that
expression in the religious arena. Creole nationalism came
to terms with the powerful religiosity and spiritualism of
117the masses most oppressed under the colonial order,
incorporating and accommodating indigenous and African
symbols into Catholic Church doctrine and the Christian
cultural milieu. In the nineteenth century Spanish America,
in particular, was the staging ground for the emergence of
a decidedly separatist and revolutionary agenda, but one
rooted and nourished by a distinct American culture that
had been developing in fits and starts from the moment of
the first encounters between Europeans, Africans, and
Indians on the soil of the “New World.” This cultural
expression legitimized the more powerful economic and
political breach that increasingly divided Europe and Latin
America.
1183
Competing Notions of Freedom
As the eighteenth century passed the halfway mark,
sporadic demands for freedom, sovereignty, equality, and
justice began to give rise to organized political actions.
However, what different groups meant by freedom – and
even whom they viewed as their oppressors – varied
according to race, social class, and status, and occasionally
gender. Creoles of European background were aware of
sentiments for independence emanating from the British
colonies of North America, and along with Thomas
Jefferson (1743–1826), Benjamin Franklin (1706–90) and
others, they were reading, discussing, and disputing the
ideas of the Enlightenment. As noted earlier, North
America’s successful war of independence and the
uprising of the French masses against a corrupt and
decadent monarchy inspired patriots in Latin America and
the Caribbean to take the same road. The Napoleonic Wars
following the revolution in France had a particularly strong
impact on Latin America. It could even be argued that
Napoleon Bonaparte’s (1769–1821) invasion of much of
Europe, with the intent of deposing monarchs everywhere
and establishing his own empire, had the effect of pushing
Latin America toward independence from Spain. The
Napoleonic invasion of Spain and Portugal in 1807
undermined Iberian authority in the colonies, leading
eventually to the outbreak of the independence wars.
Although Latin American Creoles shared many of the
same grievances as their counterparts in the British
119colonies of North America, the land, people, customs, and
traditions differed dramatically. From Mexico (which at
this time extended as far as the northern border of Alta
California), through the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola, to
Argentina and Chile at the tip of Antarctica, the Spanish
empire was spread over a steep and often inhospitable
terrain inhabited by Indians speaking many native
languages and rural laborers living in near-feudal relations
of servitude to local landlords. At the same time,
commerce, intellectual life, and political debate thrived in
major cosmopolitan centers from Havana, Mexico City,
and Lima to distant Buenos Aires, the latter a city that had
developed over hundreds of years as an outpost for
smuggling and evading the controls of Church and state.
Throughout the Caribbean, in many parts of the lands now
known as Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia,
and all of Brazil, slaves labored on huge estates producing
sugar, coffee, cattle; as laborers in mines; as well as
performing every type of job in the urban areas. In fact the
spread of slave labor far and wide in Latin America, into
areas traditionally considered Creole, mestizo, and Indian,
has only recently been uncovered. Because few people
descendant from Africa seem apparent in the populations
today of Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, even Chile and Argentina,
historians have tended to overlook the extent to which
slaves bought from Africa were a key feature of the
workforce.
Five Roads to Independence
Independence movements in Latin America and the
Caribbean proceeded down five divergent paths, starting in
the last years of the eighteenth century and continuing
120through the late nineteenth. The first broke out on the
Caribbean sugar colony of Saint-Domingue (later renamed
Haiti), where rumblings of independence from France
among planters precipitated a massive slave revolt. By
contrast, in Brazil, also a large slave-owning colony,
independence from Portugal gave way to an empire in
America, and slavery remained intact. A third path was
forged in Mexico, where independence progressed
irregularly, even erratically, pushed by an uprising from
below and met with repression from the fearful Creole
elite. The opening salvo in 1810 was a massive uprising of
indigenous and mestizo peasants following the call of
radical clergy. In response the Creole elite retreated and
held back for more than 10 years before declaring
independence under an autocratic military ruler. Mexico’s
social revolution, and a bid to improve the lives of the
masses, had to wait nearly another century. The fourth case
is that of the South American continent as a whole. There
military officers, either wealthy Creoles or supported by
them, fought the Crown at the head of armies made up of
landless casta and indigenous peasants. The effort
ultimately left South America free of colonial rule, but in
ruins and with little change in the basic class nature of the
ruling hierarchies.
Cuba and Puerto Rico constitute a fifth example, in which
belated independence movements were stolen out from
under revolutionary forces just as patriots had freedom
from Spain in their grasp. The anti-colonial struggles, and
victories, in Spanish and Portuguese America stirred
independence movements on many Caribbean islands, but
the Creoles’ fear of slave uprisings staved off
independence in Cuba, Spanish America’s most important
121Caribbean possession. There, in neighboring Puerto Rico,
and on British and other French sugar islands, elites
refused to join the revolutionary movement sweeping Latin
America, believing that colonial status, combined as it was
with prosperous sugar sales and slave labor, was preferable
to the risks that independence might entail.
The story of independence in Latin America begins not
with Spain or Portugal, but with France and a slave revolt
in 1791 in Saint-Domingue, a tiny French colony on the
western half of Hispaniola. The explosion that convulsed
this Caribbean island brought slavery, an institution that
dominated every aspect of life in the Caribbean, Brazil,
and many areas of Latin America from the sixteenth
through the nineteenth centuries, into a collision course
with the anti-colonial struggle. Before examining the slave
revolt in Haiti, however, it is important to understand the
role of African slavery in Latin America and the
Caribbean. At first glance it might seem that this
discussion takes us far afield from independence; however,
slavery and the systems of privilege it conferred on the
Creole elite were the critical backdrops to the
independence process.
African Slavery in the Americas
Although slaves of African origin traveled on Columbus’s
early voyages, it was not until 1501 that the formal trade
began, when Spain’s Catholic monarchs, Isabella
(1451–1504) and Ferdinand (1452–1516), granted to
Nicolas de Ovando (1460–1518), the appointed governor
of Hispaniola, the right to bring in slaves for sale on the
island (Maps 3.1 to 3.4 show the Atlantic slave trade
122during the period 1451 to 1870). Over the next 350 years
the Spanish colonies imported over two million slaves,
mainly concentrated along the sugar-producing coastline
settlements and islands of the Caribbean, as well as in
Mexico and Peru, and otherwise dispersed throughout the
Spanish colonies. Brazil maintained a vigorous slave trade
with Africa for over 300 years. For nearly the entire first
400 years of that country’s existence, slaves, originally
from Africa and later born into slavery in the New World,
were the main labor force. Throughout Latin America
slaves worked as field hands, on sugar and coffee
plantations as parts of large gangs, or on smallholdings
alongside a farmer who, with one or two slaves, grew corn,
manioc, beans, and fruit. Slaves worked in mines in Brazil,
Mexico, and Peru, on whaling expeditions as sailors and
oarsmen, and in warehouses extracting and processing
whale oil. Those brought from the coast of Africa
introduced rice cultivation to the Americas, taught fishing
techniques to Brazilian settlers, and intermixed with
Spanish and Portuguese explorers and indigenous captives
to create the backlands’ cowboy-frontiersmen
bandeirantes of Brazil and gauchos of Argentina. As
opposed to the US South, where slaves were mainly rural
field hands, in both urban and rural areas of Latin America
slaves filled all jobs. They worked as skilled laborers,
domestic servants, wet nurses, field hands, in the military,
and occasionally even supervised other slaves. They were
hired out as prostitutes, offered as parts of wedding
dowries, as prizes in church lotteries; they served at Mass,
lived as concubines, and transported any type of produce,
animal, mineral, or person in conveyances ranging from
wagons and buggies to sedan chairs.
123Slaves, amply replenished through a brisk trade from West
Africa, were worked to death in less than five years on
Caribbean sugar islands and in 8–10 years on the
plantations of northeast Brazil. In no place in the Americas
did the slave population reproduce itself in large numbers
except, curiously, in the United States. The reason was that
the new US republic, in its pre-cotton boom era, ended the
external slave trade in 1808, a feature of the compromise
that had ensured the ratification of the Constitution 20
years earlier. With the invention of the cotton gin in 1792,
which breathed new life into cotton production, US
planters embarked on a strategy of slave breeding to
replenish the supply internally. By 1860 and the outbreak
of the Civil War, the entire US slave population had been
born in America, numbering almost four million. Although
the US, in both the colonial and post-colonial eras,
imported an estimated 523,000 humans – less than five
percent of the total number of Africans sold into slavery in
the Americas – it had one of the largest slave populations
in the hemisphere by the time of abolition. By contrast,
Spanish America imported approximately 2.5 million
slaves, slightly more than 20 percent of the total Atlantic
slave trade, and Brazil alone imported some 4 million,
representing 35 percent of the entire trade, during the
nearly four centuries in which slavery existed in the
Americas. A particularly stark comparison can be seen in
the cases of Cuba and the United States. Cuba brought in
more than 595,000 slaves in the last 50 years of the trade
(1816–67), or 70,000 more than the US ever imported.

127High death rates, combined with larger numbers of
runaways and greater levels of manumission (granting a
slave freedom), meant that Latin American and Caribbean
societies had fewer slaves than the US at any given time.
However, throughout the colonial period, and later in
Brazil, the slaves of Latin America were frequently
Africanborn, more prone toward rebellion, less assimilated
into Spanish or Portuguese language and culture, and
comprised a much higher percentage of the total
population. In 1827, near the end of the Spanish American
rebellions, census data listed 18.2 percent of the population
as white, compared with 81.9 percent people of color,
divided among Indians, blacks, mestizos, and mixed-race
black and white, or mulattos. For Portuguese America the
difference was nearly the same, with whites comprising
23.4 percent of the population and people of color 76.7,
128divided among blacks, Indians, mulattos, and caboclos
(Brazilian term for European-Indian mixture). Given the
limitations that had been imposed on people of color since
the early colonial period – slavery, debt peonage,
marginalized and restricted access to public space, poverty,
and humiliation – the grievances of the latter group were
directed not at distant imperial centers in Madrid and
Lisbon, but instead at local planters, hacendados,
merchants, and the slaveholding clergy. Wealthy Creoles
weighed the extent of their grievances with the Crown
against their need for the royal military that held their
societies in the order that best served their class interest.
Not without reason, they feared the uprising of the masses
of Indians, slaves, and the poor of all racial and ethnic
groups should there be any outbreak of hostilities against
the rule of the peninsulares (people born in the Iberian
peninsula).
If slaves did everything, white masters did very little to
support their own livelihood, take care of their homes,
children, or the world they inhabited. The French colony of
Saint-Domingue had an estimated 500,000 slaves, or 15
slaves for every white person. Not only did slaves perform
all labor on the island, but they were driven so hard, and
died so frequently of overwork, starvation, disease, and
sleep deprivation, that the entire African-born population
turned over every 20 years. As C. L. R. James explained in
his classic study of the Haitian Revolution, in terms of
work,
no white man did any work that he could get a Negro to do
for him. A barber summoned to attend to a customer
appeared in silk attire, hat under his arm, sword at his side,
129cane under his elbow, followed by four Negroes. One of
them combed the hair, another dressed it, a third curled it
and the fourth finished... At the slightest slackness, at the
slightest mistake, he boxed the cheek of the unfortunate
slave so hard that often he knocked him over... The same
hand which had knocked over the slave closed on an
enormous fee, and the barber took his exit with the same
insolence and elegance as before.”1
Slavery and the Countryside
Because of the importance of sugar exports to the local
economies of Brazil and the Caribbean islands, over 70
percent of slaves worked on sugar plantations and adjacent
mills. They also worked in the production of tobacco, rice,
cotton, fruit, manioc, corn, beans, and other staple crops.
Although the majority of slaves brought to the Americas
were men, women were brought to Caribbean slave
plantations for the same reasons as African men – to
provide labor. Many plantations had absentee planters,
who lived in Europe and left overseers (themselves slaves
or freed people of color) to manage the plantations. In the
Caribbean, with mainly absentee planters, there were few
massive plantation houses, such as the antebellum
mansions of the US Deep South and thus less need for
female house slaves. Not only did the overwhelming
majority of female slaves, therefore, work in the fields, but
almost half of all field hands were women. This was the
case, despite the reduced number of women. Female slaves
cut cane, weeded and fertilized the plants, fed the cane
stalks into the mill grinders, looked after children, and
tended the garden vegetables that supplemented the slaves’
meager diet. Men cut cane and worked in the mill; they
130also worked as carpenters, blacksmiths, valets, drivers,
overseers, and even as part of the plantation’s militia.
After the 1808 slave revolt and revolution in Haiti, Cuba
became the foremost sugar-producing area of the
Americas, with coffee and tobacco adding to planters’
wealth. Travelers report scenes of more than 500 slaves at
a time working on the large Cuban estates, with hundreds
of men and women feeding the stalks into the huge mills
and hauling away the boiling juice. Slavery had existed in
Cuba since 1700, but doubled in the years before 1810 and
increasingly supported a resident planter elite. Because of
the comparatively late start of sugar production, it
developed as a more highly capitalized enterprise; many
slaves worked in steam-powered mills, along with the
large numbers working in the fields, and in slaveholders’
homes in both urban and rural areas.
In Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, and Brazil, women more
frequently worked in households, cooking, cleaning,
washing and repairing clothing, and caring for the planter’s
children while overseeing slave children. On the ranches
slaves worked alongside free laborers and freedmen,
tending cattle, cultivating cocoa beans, herding sheep, and
were sometimes beyond the oversight of the owners for
extended periods. In terms of pure inhumane labor, time in
the mines of Brazil, Mexico, or Peru was probably the
worst job of all. For the slaves who worked the pits,
mining was sometimes a death sentence. They stood in
water panning for gold or diamonds all day, were given
very little to eat, worked long hours, and suffered from
constant fevers and lethargy resulting from toxins in
131mercury and other minerals used in the processing of gold
and metals.
Slavery in the Cities
Africans and their freed descendants were responsible for
building the infrastructure of American societies, working
as skilled and unskilled laborers, fishermen, on docks, on
ships, and in construction. Travelers to Brazil frequently
reported that there were few carts or wagons drawn by
horses and mules in the cities. Instead slaves “are the
beasts of draught as well as of burden. The loads they drag,
and the roads they drag them over, are enough to kill both
mules and horses.”2 Cargo was moved on the backs of
slaves or in parcels and carts dragged along the ground.
Since in Africa people traditionally carried huge, heavy
loads on their heads, slaves introduced the practice to
America. Travelers marveled in their diaries at the sight of
rail-thin slave women transporting on their heads cotton,
textiles, jars of water, sometimes while carrying a baby
strapped to their bodies. Platoons of slave children and
adults of both sexes scurried through city streets balancing
enormous tubs filled with the daily slop and human
excrement collected from homes and workplaces and
conveyed to dumps. One observer in Rio de Janeiro
compared the work of slaves with that of oxen: “A week
ago I stood to observe eight oxen drag an ordinary
wagon-load of building stone for the Capuchins up the
steep Castle hill; it was straining work for them to ascend a
few rods at a time; today I noticed similar loads of stone
discharged at the foot of the ascent, and borne up on
negroes’ heads.”3
132Both men and women, along with children, were engaged
in all forms of labor in the cities. In Brazil curtained sedan
chairs, called cadeiras, suspended from a single pole that
rested on the shoulders of two or more slaves, were the
universal form of travel for white men and women (Figure
3.1). “You meet with captains of ships, English and
American sailors, fashionable ladies, bishops and fat
priests, passengers from emigrant ships, the old and the
young, the lame and the blind, all riding about in these
cadeiras.”4
Figure 3.1 This engraving from the 1800s shows two
slaves carrying a woman in her sedan chair, with her
attendants walking behind. The slaves are in formal attire,
to indicate the high status of the woman, but are barefoot,
to indicate their enslavement. (Thomas Ewbank, Life in
Brazil, 1856)
Masters set female slaves to work as prostitutes, many at a
very young age. Prostitution was a lucrative source of
income for slave owners. Moreover, far from the watchful
133eye of “polite society” and the church hierarchy, priests in
Cuba, Hispaniola, and remote (or not so remote) areas of
Brazil frequented slave prostitutes, forced sex on their
female slaves, and kept concubines. In addition, slave
women were used as wet nurses for the babies of their
mistresses, since in elite circles it was considered
indelicate for a woman to breastfeed her baby. Sometimes
mistresses rented out their wetnurse slaves to others. Little
is known of the fate of these women’s newborn children,
but historian Robert Conrad speculates that in Brazil the
infants may have been taken from the slave mothers to
orphanages or perhaps sold. Newspapers were filled with
advertisements such as this one: “For rent, a wet nurse
with very good milk, from her first pregnancy, gave birth
six days ago, in the Rua dos Pescadores, No. 64. Be it
advised that she does not have a child.”5
In Mexico, Peru,
Brazil and wherever there were slaves, wealthy mistresses
had personal attendants. Secluded in their townhouses or
isolated on rural plantations, elite women relied on
personal slaves as their closest confidantes and often their
only company. It was not unusual for enslaved wet nurses,
nannies, and house servants, male and female, to grow
fond of the infants and children they tended and even to
develop a loyalty to their mistresses and masters. Such
loyalty had its rewards. A valued personal servant who
served a family faithfully for many years could be granted
his or her freedom later in life. Nonetheless, the short
lifespan of slaves in Latin America indicates that overall
slavery was brutal, and likewise points to the futility of
disputing whether masters in one country or another were
kinder. C. L. R. James offers the most succinct appraisal:
“There were good and bad Governors, good and bad
Intendents, as there were good and bad slave owners. But
134this was a matter of pure chance. It was the system that
was bad.”6
Treatment and Punishment
By law in any slaveholding society of Latin America
masters could either punish their slaves on the plantation
or bring them to police stations, where for a fee the slave
would be whipped for serious crimes such as running
away, striking an overseer, or theft. For the most part
slaveholders meted out punishments on their own estates,
since towns were distant and often inaccessible. There is
little evidence that women were treated better than men, in
Brazil or elsewhere. Although women were probably not
whipped as often as men and were instead placed in chains
or stocks, there is every indication that they were severely
abused. A house guest at a plantation reported watching
the master pin a female house servant to a tree post by
driving a huge nail through her ear because she had broken
a plate. Left there overnight, the young woman escaped by
tearing the head of the nail through her ear. She was found
the next day, returned to the plantation, and whipped for
attempting to escape.
Some planters were concerned about the treatment of their
female slaves, especially to protect their ability to bear
children. Pregnant women worked cutting cane until five
or six weeks before giving birth and returned about two or
three weeks afterwards, although there are reports, mainly
from the Caribbean islands, of women forced to strap their
babies to their backs and return to the fields in a few days.
Planters on Saint-Domingue used the “four post” to punish
pregnant women, a method in which a hole was dug in the
135earth to accommodate her belly while lashes were “laid
on” her back. A heavy iron collar with tentacles extended
all around was specifically reserved for women suspected
of aborting the fetus, or killing a newborn child to save
their offspring from the horrors of the slave life. The collar
was not removed until the woman had produced a child.
Again James offers a prescient observation: “Undoubtedly
there were kind masters who did not indulge in these
refinements of cruelty and whose slaves merely suffered
over-work, under-nourishment and the whip.”7
Slavery and the Church
Rarely did the clergy in Spanish or Portuguese America
raise an outcry against the enslavement of Africans. The
Church’s position toward the enslavement of Africans was
very different from its role in opposing Indian slavery.
Several Catholic friars, most notably Bartolomé de las
Casas, whose work is described in Chapter 2, were
instrumental in seeing the harsh encomienda system and
Indian slavery abolished because it had contributed to the
drastic decline of the Indian population. At the core of this
difference in approach was the fact that Africans had been
enslaved in Europe since ancient times, and were not
considered to have the childish “innocence” the Church
attributed to the indigenous people of the New World.
Africans, the logic went, had had the opportunity to accept
Christianity and had rejected it, and thus could be
dominated and enslaved according to the principles of
“just war.”
On the other hand, Catholic doctrine accepted Africans as
children of God, and the Church mandated that all slaves
136be baptized, administered the sacraments, and permitted to
attend weekly Mass. In addition, owners were required to
allow slaves the Christian “day of rest,” which in truth
interfered little with productivity on plantations, since
slaves used that time to tend to their gardens and repair
clothing. Whereas slaves in the United States were not
allowed to marry, in Latin America the Catholic Church
made marriage a requirement, and the couple could not be
“honorably” separated, although it certainly may have
happened. Nonetheless, there is scant evidence of the
Catholic Church speaking out against slavery, with the
exception of occasional reprimands against particularly
sadistic masters, rebukes to owners who refused slaves the
sacraments, or, infrequently, admonishments against the
widespread practice of masters keeping slave concubines.
More often the Church was subservient to the slaveholders,
especially in Brazil where planters built chapels on their
plantations and retained priests to attend to the spiritual
needs of their households and slaves. Priests and nuns had
personal slaves, and brotherhoods, monasteries, and
convents had large numbers of slaves working for them.
One of the largest convents in Mexico City bordered the
slave market, where nuns purchased their own personal
slaves or those that toiled in the convent. In colonial Peru
convents were large establishments, inhabited by rich and
worldly women who chose to live a sequestered life rather
than to accept a distasteful marriage partner. Inside these
convents, elite women kept personal slaves, who tended to
their luxurious quarters, helped with their wardrobe, and
ran errands to the outside world.
137A particularly revealing indication of the Church’s
participation in the slave system is a record of lottery
prizes from the Santa Casa de Misericórdia in the city of
Ouro Prêto, Brazil. Slaves as young as one year old, others
6, 8, 16, and 32 years of age, along with leather couches,
an English writing desk, a musket and “horse bridle of fine
silver” were listed as prizes in a fundraiser for this
Catholic charity.8 Brazil’s leading abolitionist, Joaquim
Nabuco, offered a stinging indictment of the collusion of
the Church with the system of slavery: “No priest ever
tried to stop a slave auction; none ever denounced the
religious regimen of the slave quarters. The Catholic
Church, despite its immense power in a country still
greatly fanaticized by it, never raised its voice in Brazil in
favor of emancipation.”9
African Medicine and Religious Practices
The extent to which the Catholic clergy administered to
slaves varied depending on locale, the proclivity of
individual priests and planters, and the receptivity of the
slaves toward Catholicism. In general, slaves adopted
Catholicism loosely and incorporated its outward rituals
into their own system of African religious belief and
practice. Despite wide variations, most African religions
practiced in slave quarters centered on the idea of a
supreme being, a set of non-human gods usually associated
with natural forces (water, sun, crops, corn, etc.), ancestor
worship and the use of charms, devices, and potions to
alter one’s life on earth, and sometimes to provide for
happiness in the afterlife. Despite the immense efforts of
the Catholic Church – and whatever one thinks of its
methods or motives, the Church took seriously its
138responsibility to convert African and Indian “heathens” – it
was largely unsuccessful. In the realm of religious belief,
far and above any other aspect of life, African culture still
flourishes in many areas of Latin America and the
Caribbean.
Religion was the one area of a slave’s life that was truly
his or her own; thus the continued practice of African
religious traditions, in defiance of planters and the Church,
became a method of resisting slavery. The 1791 slave
rebellion on SaintDomingue, which grew into the largest
and most successful revolt in the Americas, began in the
clandestine ceremonies of a voodoo priest named
Boukman. Decades later, in 1835, in northeastern Brazil
Muslim slaves inspired the Malé Revolt. Malé, the
Yoruban word for Muslim, was an uprising led by Muslim
religious leaders slated to begin on January 25, the day of a
Catholic holiday that corresponded with the end of the
holiest Muslim holiday of Ramadan. Although the police
uncovered the plot before it began, over 500 slaves
participated anyway, fighting for much of a day before
being defeated by the local police and militia.
In keeping with their role in West African culture, slave
women in Latin America played a prominent role in
religious ceremonies and held the position as medical
practitioners, or curanderas, in the community. The
practice of superficially worshipping the Christian God
and praying to the saints allowed the slaves to substitute
their African deities and develop syncretic religions such
as Santería (Spanish America) and candomblé (Brazil).
The syncretic Christian-African religions that developed
out of the slave quarters called on a spiritual force to
139facilitate human interaction with the saints who in turn
were the intermediaries with God. Devotees carried out
various rituals and participated in ceremonies involving
dancing rhythmically, smoking cigars, re-enacting
religious stories, and, at its peak, entering into a trance, the
latter as the ultimate demonstration of human submission
to the power of the high spirit. Different from the male
hierarchy in Christianity, women were priestesses and at
the center of African-based religious practice. Three
former slave women founded the first candomblé center
outside of the slave quarters in 1830 in the northeast city of
Salvador. Throughout the Americas, slaves, similar to the
practice of indigenous people of the Americas, often
became Christians on the outside, but continued to practice
their native religions in private. Even planters who sought
to convert all their slaves admitted that many were not
really Christians.
Religious and medical practices overlapped in Africa, as
well as among slaves and freed persons in the Americas.
Since European medicine in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries involved emptying the body of its affliction by
“bleeding, blistering, purging or puking,” undoubtedly the
herbal remedies of the African priests were more
successful, or at least they did not do as much harm as
opening a vein to drain out blood from the sick person,
administering purgatives and applying leeches. Doctors
who traveled to the Caribbean islands or Brazil’s sugar and
coffee regions derided the slaves’ use of medicinal herbs
as the work of sorcerers and witches and warned against
the “unusual effect” the slaves’ remedies could produce.
Quite likely many among the whites feared these “effects,”
especially slaves’ claims that they could bring down hexes
140and bad luck on cruel masters. Given that European
medicine was little more sophisticated in some of its
theories until the late nineteenth century, there is every
reason to believe that whites who lived in a highly
superstitious world were prone to fear, as well as to
actually feel, the aches and pains the slaves wished on
them. Certainly they had reason to fear being poisoned.
Finally, although slaveholders voiced disdain for the
slave’s medicine, many whites who consulted the healers
of the slave quarters claimed to have found relief from the
African medicines. In the slave cabins of the Caribbean
and Brazil, following African custom, age conferred
respect, lending the elders, both men and women, positions
of leadership in the community, in secret societies, and in
regulating and governing the social order.
Post-menopausal women were held in especially high
regard since they were no longer chained to their
biological role and thus able to assume political and
cultural leadership of the village, equal to men.
Resistance and Rebellion
Scholars have long recognized that slave rebellions were
most intense in societies with a large percentage of slaves
newly arrived from Africa. Slaves retained close ties to
African religion and traditions; they were most likely to
run away, form maroon communities, called quilombos in
Brazil and cimarróns in Spanish America, and reinstitute
African practices. And where the traditions of Africa
persevered, revolts were common. Brazilian slave quarters
were alive with the languages, religions, and rituals of
Africa. Slaves came from different areas of Africa,
although a large number were of the Yoruban ethnic group
141from Nigeria and Benin, while others were Bantu-speaking
people. The language and cultural differences that
separated the slaves initially made it difficult to
communicate with each other in the diaspora. Over time,
however, African customs blended together to form an
Afro-Brazilian culture, within which the strongest
influence was Yoruban ritual and practice. For almost the
entire seventeenth century in the interior of the state of
Pernambuco, Brazil had the largest runaway slave
community in the Americas, known as the Quilombo de
Palmares. “Palmares,” meaning the land of the palm trees,
had over 11,000 inhabitants at its height living in a fully
functioning African community in terms of language,
customs, religion, and even African forms of slavery. Until
its final defeat in 1694, Palmares repelled hundreds of
colonial and Portuguese military assaults. Despite its
defeat, the spirit of the quilombo lived on. Over a century
later in 1809 a group of Aja-Fon and Yoruba slaves ran
away from sugar plantations in Bahia and formed a
quilombo from which they attacked a nearby village to get
food. They controlled the village of Nazaré for several
months before being defeated by troops sent from the
capital.
In contrast with the United States, where slaves’ direct
knowledge of Africa was minimal after a generation or
two, nearly every slave community in Spanish, Portuguese,
and French America had members within it who spoke
African languages, practiced African religions, played
African musical instruments, cooked food in the style they
knew in Africa, organized their families and their gender
relations according to the ways of their homeland. As late
as 1864 Cuban colonial authorities thwarted a slave
142rebellion intended to kill all the whites. The Spanish court
where the conspirators were tried was compelled to bring
in translators because the defendants only knew their
African language.
Another factor contributing to the likelihood of slave
revolts – and definitely feeding the paranoia of the planter
class – was that slaves, along with free people of color, far
outnumbered whites in many areas. In Brazil, by 1808,
slaves made up 38 percent of the total population of about
three million, with the rest spread fairly evenly among
whites and free people of color. That meant that in Brazil
63 percent of the population was comprised of slaves,
former slaves, or the descendants of slaves. In the
Caribbean islands slaves and people of color far
outnumbered whites: Saint-Domingue in 1789 had 459,277
slaves and free people of color, and only 30,831 whites.
Other French islands such as Martinique and Guadeloupe
had similar ratios. Over half of Cuba’s population in the
mid-nineteenth century was slaves and free people of
color, outnumbering the whites. The sheer number of
non-whites afforded cover for runaways and left slave
owners in constant fear of revolts.
The Caribbean society with the largest number of slave
revolts, Jamaica, had 310,000 slaves and free coloreds in
1800, compared to 30,000 whites, while in 1834 the divide
between the two groups had grown to 356,200 to 20,000.
Jamaica had more slave revolts than all other British
islands combined, and, with the exception of the Haitian
Revolution, involved more slaves in uprisings than any
other Caribbean island. The sugar economy on Jamaica
was very dynamic, resulting in large numbers of estates.
143When planters established new sugar plantations, they
imported hundreds of slaves all at once to stock it, usually
directly from Africa. The arrival of a shipload of African
slaves lent itself to violent uprisings, often sweeping
neighboring plantations as well and sometimes involving
thousands of slaves.
In Spanish America, especially Peru and Mexico, systems
of forced labor varied. Indigenous communities were
required to contribute laborers to the haciendas, while
maintaining residence in their own towns, or, more
commonly, entered into a kind of widespread
sharecropping relationship with Creole or Spanish
landowners. In addition, many Indian towns entered fairly
easily into the market economy the colonists established,
since such a method for buying and selling foodstuffs,
crafts, and labor was consistent with practices of the
pre-colonial era. As the decline in indigenous population
lessened in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
more Indians and mestizos were available for work and
became incorporated into the religious, political, and
economic life of the Spanish cities and towns.
This extensive discussion of slavery and labor systems is
important to establish the basis for the onset and the
outcome of independence movements in Latin America. In
the early years of the nineteenth century there was
discontent with the rule of the Iberian monarchs, but very
little outright opposition. Independence was not on the
agenda anywhere. Even the most rabidly anti-colonial
Creoles were aware that the extreme differences in class
and access to wealth would affect any major upheaval. In
addition, the huge numbers of people living and working
144under conditions of coerced labor on plantations, rural
estates, and in the cities, who were of Indian, African, and
mixed-race backgrounds, far outnumbered the Creole elite.
Nonetheless, the Creoles protested their suffocation under
the colonial monopoly and the humiliation they suffered at
the hands of the peninsulares and colonial authorities, fully
realizing that they needed the support of the masses if they
hoped to launch a rebellion.
The merchants and planters of Latin America complained
that the Crown prevented their access to political office,
imposed taxes, fines, and petty restrictions from afar,
limited the markets with which they could trade, and sent
corrupt and inefficient colonial agents to lord over them.
Although grievances against the British in North America
were similar to those in the Latin American colonies, the
outcome of the two revolutionary wars was very different.
Slavery was abolished in Spanish America in the wake of
independence, as a necessary condition for conscripting an
army of adequate size and strength to combat the Spanish.
By contrast, the republicans who shaped the new United
States sidestepped the question of abolition for a hundred
years, only to have it divide the states in civil war from
1861 to 1865, or what some historians have called the
“second American revolution.”
The Sugar Colony of Saint-Domingue
In a completely unexpected turn of events, the struggle for
Latin America’s independence can be traced to the
sugar-producing island of Saint-Domingue. As a French
possession, accounts of the slave revolt on
Saint-Domingue, usually referred to as the Haitian
145Revolution, have warranted only a marginal role in
histories of Spanish and Portuguese America. It should
hold a more central place because its importance to the
narrative of independence in the Americas is indisputable.
First, the slave revolt on SaintDomingue represented most
graphically the limitations of the Enlightenment and the
revolutionary ideals of liberté, equalité, and fraternité that
were so central to the anticolonial and anti-monarchical
designs of Latin America’s Creole elite. Secondly, the
slave insurgents did what no other independence struggle
in the Americas had done before it, or would afterward.
They secured their independence by proclaiming their own
freedom, a move that laid bare the prevailing hypocrisy of
the white elites’ notion of sovereignty for slaveholders, but
not for slaves. For their audacity the Haitians paid a dear
price. The only black republic of America was isolated,
invaded, boycotted, embargoed, and in every way
undermined and punished for its revolution. The racism
and subterfuge of the European colonial powers of Spain,
France, and England, as well as hostility from the young
US republic, set the standard for the world’s policy toward
Haiti in the revolutionary and post-revolutionary era.
Finally, the specter of slave revolts and the brutality of the
uprising and subsequent war on all sides served as a brake
on independence movements in other slaveholding
societies, especially Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico,
and Brazil.
At the time, Saint-Domingue, one of the smallest of
France’s possessions in the late eighteenth century, was the
largest sugar producer in the Americas, surpassing Brazil
and Jamaica. Sugar was planted, tended, harvested, and
shipped entirely by men, women, and children who
146worked under some of the most abhorrent, inhumane, and
life-threatening conditions of any slave society. In addition
to a large number of slaves, the island population was
divided into three castes comprised of a tiny group of
whites (grands blancs) who held all the power and much
of the property and lived mostly in France; lesser whites
(petits blancs) who held local political office and
maintained the militia, worked as artisans and small
entrepreneurs, and resented the grands blancs; and a third
group of free persons of color. In Saint-Domingue, the
slaves were very African, and the planters very European.
Mulattos, meanwhile, controlled nearly all property and
wealth not in the hands of large planters, and were for that
reason despised by less affluent whites. The mulattos
represented many generations of descendants of the
widespread practice of intercourse between slave women
and white men. They had obtained their freedom due to
their master’s guilt or generosity, or were skilled laborers
who had purchased their freedom. As punishment for their
hard work, thrift, and ultimate prosperity, they were
subjected to a humiliating and endless set of petty
restrictions designed to keep them “in their place.”
The revolutionary events in France in 1789 rumbled in
waves onto the colonies, affecting each caste in a different
way, but the cumulative effect was as a match to a powder
keg. When revolution broke out in France, overturning the
monarchy, the planters of Saint-Domingue immediately
cheered, since they saw the revolution especially the
pronouncements in favor of greater commercial freedom –
as a way to end the colonial monopoly and thus further
enrich themselves. From 1789 until 1791 the island men of
property and standing argued and negotiated with each
147other, and with the political clubs of Paris, over the
distribution of economic and political rights, especially the
granting of full equality to mulattos, and even began to
broach the issue of the abolition of slavery.
The Slave Revolt
In 1791 a slave revolt led by Boukman, a voodoo priest,
erupted in the north of the island, spread in three days to
the south, and soon enveloped the entire colony, pushing
hostilities between mulattos and whites, the homeland and
the colony, to the backseat. Given the brutality of the slave
system, it was no wonder that the uprising was from the
beginning extremely bloody. From 1791 until the end of
the revolts and the war with France (and other European
powers), hundreds of thousands of blacks on the island
died. They fought with abandon at first and then as a
disciplined army under the leadership of former slaves
turned military strategists, since as the campaign unfolded
returning to slavery became the most repellent of all
options. No part of the island and no section of the
population, slave or free, man, woman or child, was left
untouched. In the few accounts that have survived, written
exclusively by planters, there is repeated mention of
fighting by female slaves and the ferociousness of these
women in battle (Figure 3.2).
By May 1794 the uprising was under the skillful leadership
of Toussaint L’Overture (1743–1803), a former slave who
had learned to read and write and studied both
Figure 3.2 Neg Mawon or Marron Inconnnu (The

Enlightenment philosophy and military tactics. His task,
however, was overwhelming, since Toussaint and his army
of former slaves found themselves not only facing the
planters’ small militia, but also caught in the international
intrigue among world powers – all of whom wanted to
meddle in this war to obtain some advantage. Spain
supported the slave uprising in hopes of winning back the
French colony and joining it to Santo Domingo on the
eastern part of the island, from which it had split off a
century earlier. Fearing the revolt would spread to other
slave societies in the Caribbean and the mainland United
States, Britain jumped in on the side of the
Saint-Domingue whites, while the US looked on nervously
and refused to admit any ships from the French colonies to
southern ports lest word of the rebellion reach the slaves in
the US.
149The slave revolt triumphed and Toussaint tried to
reorganize the plantations and convince former slaves to
return to their jobs so that sugar sales could generate
sufficient revenue to rebuild the country. But political
intrigue among former planters and mulattos and resistance
from ex-slaves to return to the hated plantation routine
eventually stymied the country’s progress. General
Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), the new leader of the
French Republic, recognized Toussaint as
“captain-general” of the colony, only to betray him shortly
thereafter, ordering an invasion to restore the rule of the
white planters, a move that won full support from the
United States and England. French property holders,
whose goal was the overthrow of the French monarchy and
the installation of men of business to run society, found
themselves in a quandary. At first France’s revolutionary
government had denounced slavery, but the
property-holding “revolutionaries” then remembered their
bank accounts. It had been on the backs of slaves on
distant sugar estates that the new class of French capitalists
had grown rich, and it was this wealth that had
emboldened them to overthrow the decadent monarchy.
The bourgeoisie now had bills to pay at home, armies to
outfit, and peasants, shopkeepers, and the entire emerging
middle class clamoring for an end to the heavy taxes.
Without the profits from sugar-producing islands, based on
the servitude of slaves who worked the plantations,
republican France was in jeopardy. There was, of course,
no end to the justification for this double standard.
Supporters of Saint-Domingue’s slave system from among
the revolutionaries in Paris argued that “these coarse men
[the blacks] are incapable of knowing liberty and enjoying
it with wisdom,” and as such need to be held in bondage
150until such time as they understand.10Ultimately, the white
governments of Europe and America chose to protect their
property, inanimate and human alike, rather than extend
“the rights of man” to blacks.
Probably no other action more belied racial and class
solidarity than the duplicity of the imperial powers’
alliance with France. Although nearly at war with
Napoleon’s armies throughout Europe, England found the
French army preferable to the enlightened Toussaint
L’Ouverture, while the US, only just free of its own
colonial oppression, opted to ally with the colonial powers
of England and France rather than give aid to
Saint-Domingue’s anti-colonial struggle. It was, in fact, in
their views toward the Haitian Revolution that North
America’s revolutionary leaders demonstrated the limits of
their Enlightenment philosophy. In 1791 George
Washington (1732–99) urged that the new United States
republic come to France’s aid to “crush the alarming
insurrection of the Negroes in St. Domingo.” Thomas
Jefferson in 1799 referred to Toussaint L’Ouverture and
the other leaders of the slave uprising as “the cannibals of
the terrible Republic.”
The Revolution Betrayed
In 1802 Napoleon’s brother-in-law General Charles
Leclerc (1772–1802), leading a force of 20,000 soldiers
including Swiss and Polish conscripts, launched an
invasion of Saint-Domingue with the intention of
re-establishing the colonial empire. He then captured
Toussaint and sent him to France, where the latter died in
prison on April 7, 1803. With the full support of its
151European and US allies, the Napoleonic army slaughtered
the insurgents, only to find themselves in turn defeated
both by a combination of blacks’ resistance and disease,
especially yellow fever. Leclerc died of disease, as did
thousands of his soldiers. Succeeding armies fought on,
racking up tremendous losses, untold atrocities, and
expenses so massive that Napoleon sold the huge
Louisiana territory to the US to raise revenue to defray his
military losses. The French forces lagged in the face of
untiring assaults from the black army under the leadership
of Jean-Jacques Dessalines (1758–1806), a skillful military
officer of dubious integrity who had fought with Toussaint,
had at one point betrayed him to support Leclerc, and then
returned to the rebels’ side against the French. French
invaders found themselves facing a guerrilla force they
could not pin down. The term “guerrilla” (small war) had
been coined in Spain during Napoleon’s invasion and
occupation of the country. There, irregular bands of
Spanish fighters attacked the occupiers and beat them, just
like Dessalines’ army on the other side of the ocean.
In the 22 months that Napoleon’s army battled on the
island, it had lost over 40,000 troops. As the army retreated
to the coast, its soldiers destroyed the island, setting fire to
cane fields, leveling towns and villages, and killing every
man, woman, and child they encountered. Fearing that the
news of the successful slave rebellion would spread to
their other Caribbean colonies (news had already reached
Guadeloupe and inspired a revolt), the French government
had ordered the military to eliminate every black who had
tasted freedom. In January 1804 Dessalines declared
victory, renamed the new country Haiti (supposedly its
Arawak name of old), tore the white middle from the
152French tricolor flag and raised the red and blue banner of
the new nation. Whether the small white square, added
later, bearing a coat of arms symbolizes the reduced status
of whites is only speculative. In a few short years Haiti
moved from the most productive land in the Caribbean to
an impoverished, ecologically ruined outpost whose
population was afforded no way to rebuild a new economy
on the ashes of the destroyed sugar monoculture.
Universally illiterate, devoid of agricultural and
technological know-how, exhausted from a war that had
taken thousands of lives and nearly all the young,
able-bodied men, the remainder of Haiti’s people turned to
digging in the soil with sticks to eke out a subsistence.
Although the leaders of slaveholding societies attempted to
prevent tales of the Haitian revolt from spreading to their
own lands and inspiring similar actions, the events on the
French island spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean.
Laurent Dubois’s history of the impact of the Haitian
Revolution in the Caribbean, aptly entitled Avengers of the
New World, tells of many instances wherein news about
Haiti and the struggle of the slaves there served as both a
battle cry of freedom and an instrument for the spread of
Enlightenment ideology among slaves. For Latin
America’s Creole elite the lesson of the Haitian Revolution
was clear: insurgency against a colonial power was a risky
business. Among planters in the US, the opinion was much
the same. President Jefferson’s secretary of state Albert
Gallatin (1761–1849) argued against entering into trade
with the newly liberated Haiti, even going so far as to say
that the right of self-determination should be denied to
other peoples on occasion, especially if the population was
not white.
153Brazil’s Independent Empire
Like their counterparts throughout the Americas, Brazilian
Creoles were aware of the era’s revolutionary movements
and shared many of the grievances against the Crown that
had prompted change in distant lands. Nonetheless, word
of the slave uprising in Saint-Domingue, and the fate of the
white planters there, instilled caution, if not outright fear,
among planters who chafed under Portuguese restrictions
but were aware that their own society, worked as it was by
slave labor, was infused with the same resentment, anger,
and potential for widespread rebellion as the former
French colony. Conspiracies to overthrow the
Portuguese-led government had come and gone in the late
eighteenth century, and most were notable for their
reluctance to involve the poor, free, or unfree persons in
their plans.
Brazil’s road to independence began in November 1807
when the Portuguese Court of the House of Braganza fled
Napoleon’s invading army for the colony in Brazil. Sailing
under the protection of their British allies, the monarch and
the 10,000 courtiers in his party stopped briefly in
Salvador da Bahia on the northeast coast, which they
found too cramped and poor, and moved a month later to
Rio de Janeiro further south. When the Court arrived in
Rio de Janeiro, it elevated the colonial capital to the status
of seat of the empire. Even when the Portuguese military
managed to drive Napoleon’s army from Portugal, the
future King João VI (1767–1826) remained in Brazil,
possibly reluctant to trade Rio’s tropical splendor for
Lisbon. Finally on December 16, 1815, after spending 13
years in Brazil, the Prince Regent declared that Brazil had
154equal status with the homeland, joining them into a single
united kingdom. Six years later, under threat from the
Lisbon Cortes and according to the mandates of the new
Portuguese constitution, which stated that he would lose
his imperial throne entirely, João VI returned to Portugal,
leaving behind his son, Pedro (1798–1834), as the Prince
Regent of Brazil. A little less than half of the Court and
military that had accompanied the king to Brazil a decade
earlier returned with him.
In 1822 the Portuguese Cortes sought to end the dual
kingdom status and reconstitute Lisbon as the sole center
of the empire. It demanded that Dom Pedro give up his
throne in Rio and return to Portugal, and that Brazil once
again assume its subordinate status. With support from the
Brazilian aristocracy – anxious to preserve their
considerable landholdings, from which they exported
sugar, coffee, and cotton – and with the backing of the
British, who were eager to monopolize trade with Brazil,
Dom Pedro moved to secure Brazil’s autonomy from
Portugal. On the banks of the Ipiranga River on September
7, 1822, the monarch declared Brazil’s independence with
what came to be known as the Cry of Ipiranga:
“Independence or Death!” On December 1 the 24-year-old
monarch had himself crowned Emperor Pedro I – a title
more in keeping with French conqueror Napoleon
Bonaparte than anything in Portugal’s monarchical
tradition. Two years later he promulgated the first
constitution. Brazil did not fight a long and bloody war to
separate from Portugal, unlike its neighbors in their
campaign for independence from Spain. There were small
uprisings among Portuguese military units in the northeast
who remained loyal to the seat of government in Lisbon,
155but little open combat. Instead, Brazil experienced
smoldering discontent among nativeborn Brazilian
merchants, planters, and lower-level bureaucrats against
the privileged and arrogant Portuguese who had elbowed
their way to the top of the former colony’s economic and
political life. This hatred of the Portuguese courtiers and
their many allies, especially in urban areas, added to class
and regional tensions and eventually disturbed the peace.
The new empire was not without its detractors; by 1830
Dom Pedro I’s popularity had begun to wane, due
especially to his authoritarian style of governance and
lavish lifestyle. Sugar planters in the northeast voiced the
greatest discontent with the new government, but felt that
their grievances went unheeded by the court in Rio. The
planters were losing their share of the international sugar
market to the more efficiently produced Cuban variety, a
situation compounded by the high cost of slaves, since the
1830 treaty with Britain abolishing the slave trade drove
up the price. Merchants, urban entrepreneurs, and liberals
were angered at the monarch’s favoritism toward
Portuguese courtiers, many of whom were seen as nothing
more than worthless hangers-on and obstacles in the path
of Brazilian autonomy. Moreover, Brazil had suffered a
humiliating defeat in a territorial war with Argentina in
1825–8, further undercutting the aspirations of the
nationalist Brazilians. In 1831 Dom Pedro I abdicated his
throne and returned to Portugal. Like his father, Dom
Pedro left behind his son, then five years old, under the
protection of a three-man council. The council, or
Regency, governed in the name of the emperor until the
youth’s 14th birthday in 1840, when he assumed the throne
as Pedro II (1825–91). Brazil functioned under an
156independent empire until 1889 when, after finally
abolishing slavery in 1888, republican military officers
seized the government. The Republic replaced the empire,
and the aged Dom Pedro II returned to Portugal with the
remnants of his royal court.
Independence in Mexico
Independence in Mexico followed a third course, but with
important similarities to the struggles in Haiti and Brazil.
In the end, Mexican independence in 1821 was the result
of the residual militancy from an 1810 radical peasant
uprising, during which hundreds of thousands of Indians
and mestizos rose up to demand their rights to land and an
end to burdensome taxes. The road to independence began
in a small village in the rural country north of the capital,
Mexico City. Historian Eric Van Young has pointed out in
his book The Other Rebellion that the rebellions were
entirely rural, never garnering support from urban areas. In
1810 Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1753–1811), a
local priest in the impoverished Indian town of Dolores
near Guanajuato, along with Ignacio Allende (1769–1811)
and a few other Creole intellectuals, met in secret to plot
the overthrow of local Spanish officials. On September 16
Hidalgo rallied thousands of local peasants, mostly Indians
and castas, in the cause of independence, under the banner
of the Virgin of Guadalupe. They marched en masse on the
provincial capital of Guanajuato. Hidalgo’s exact demands
were unclear and his military tactics even more so, but as a
priest he commanded a huge following. Priests formed a
part of what historian Stuart Voss refers to as the mainstay
of colonial society, organized under the “traditional triad
of the family, parish, and community” and dominated by
157the “patriarch, priest and local official.”11 Hidalgo drew on
his prestige to pursue his belief that the Church should
serve the people and take the side of the downtrodden.
The intensity of Hidalgo’s anti-monarchical stance,
combined with the violence of the peasant crowds aroused
by his message, horrified the Creole elite, many of whom
had initially supported the anti-colonial cause. When
Father Hidalgo rang the church bell in Dolores to signal
the beginning of the revolt, it seemed that only
impoverished Indians and mestizos responded, sending the
anti-colonial elite scurrying back into their houses to bar
their doors. Before the revolt came to an end and Father
Hidalgo was captured when his march faltered outside
Mexico City, he had managed to separate from Allende’s
army and lose control of many of his peasant followers; he
also proved unable to control widespread looting and
killing in the countryside. Moreover, the professional
Spanish army outmatched the priest’s forces of over
100,000 peasants, armed only with machetes, sticks, and
crude homemade weapons. Hidalgo’s head, along with
Allende’s and those of other rebel commanders, were
posted in metal cages at the corners of the entrances to
Mexico City. The ferocity of the rebellion was matched
only by the government’s response. Hidalgo’s revolt
clearly demonstrated the intensity of class and racial
antagonisms that the colonial regime had engendered, but
lacked planning, strategy, and organization.
In the months after Hidalgo’s death another priest, José
María Morelos y Pavón (1765–1815), took up the standard
of rebellion. Unlike Hidalgo, Father Morelos defined a
revolutionary program calling for independence from
158Spain, the creation of a republican government in which all
the Mexican people would participate, the abolition of
slavery, and elimination of divisions between races and
ethnicities. Though a priest, Morelos recognized the
suffering of the poor at the hands of the Church. He called
for termination of the Church’s special privileges and the
compulsory tithe exacted from the poor parishioners, and
demanded partition of the large estates, to be distributed
among the people. If Hidalgo’s uprising had shocked
wealthy Creoles, Morelos’ political program increased
their hostility. Through four campaigns in which the
insurgents drew together thousands of followers – and then
lost as many in the face of assaults from the Spanish
military – Morelos’s forces roamed throughout the western
coastal and central areas of the country. Eventually, as a
result of weariness, lack of military materiel, and betrayal,
Morelos retreated in the face of a reinforced Spanish army.
He was captured outside Cuernavaca in 1815, tried, placed
before a firing squad and shot. As a mass uprising destined
to redress the years of wrong and the cumulative
grievances of the poor and downtrodden, the Mexican
independence movement came to an end. In its later
reincarnation, it would emerge under the careful military
and political control of the Creole elite, content to replace
Spanish tyranny with native-born Mexican tyranny, in the
name of an independent Mexico.
Ironically enough, it was events in Spain that precipitated
revolt in the colonies. In 1812 the Spanish Cortes (the
advisory council to the throne) installed a liberal
constitution, putting into place a program similar to what
the revolutionaries in Mexico had demanded. Thus the
Spanish colonial elite, representing the interest of the
159Crown in Mexico, no longer benefited from their ties with
the Crown and joined with the Creoles to crush the masses
and declare independence. In 1821, under the leadership of
General Agustín de Iturbide (1763–1824), a military
officer whose promotion to general resulted from his
distinguished service in repressing the Hidalgo and
Morelos uprisings, Mexico separated from Spain. General
Iturbide elevated himself to emperor in May 1822, a
position he was able to assume as a reward from the
families of property and standing for declaring the nation
independent. The honeymoon was short-lived; the Creole
elite, who had been too fearful to align with the Mexican
masses earlier, now found themselves out of power
completely and once again subservient to a new
authoritarian ruler. Within a year of crowning himself
emperor, Iturbide dissolved congress, presided over the
arrest of more than 60 political officials, and embarked on
a personalist regime until his forced abdication and exile to
Italy the next year. Convinced to return in 1824, Iturbide’s
hope of reclaiming his throne proved illusory. He was
captured, court-martialed, and executed.
South American Independence
The pattern of independence wars in Spanish South
America was similar to those in Mexico and the
Caribbean. Stretching from Cartagena on the Caribbean
Sea to Buenos Aires at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata
(River Plate), the South American campaigns were led by
Creole military officers, many of whom have streets,
plazas, cities, and countries named for them today, and
whose statues – nearly always a figure mounted on
horseback – adorn the plazas of cities and parks.
160Collectively, their exploits have earned them the title
“Liberator.” Foremost among them was Simón Bolívar
(1783–1830), liberator of the North, an elite Creole whose
idealism and belief in republican values, learned in the best
schools and universities of America and Europe, came into
conflict with his distrust of the masses and pushed him
ultimately to rely on military solutions. He led armies,
penned letters, shouted proclamations, and defeated the
royalists on long marches through the lands that became
Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador. Andrés Bello
(1781–1865) was one of the main influences on Bolívar’s
intellectual formation. The two traveled to England
together in 1810 where, under Bello’s tutelage (despite the
fact that the two were nearly the same age), the future
liberator was introduced to the intellectual currents
coursing through Europe’s salons and political gatherings
of the era. Upon their return, Bello remained in the world
of politics and scholarship, while Bolívar opted for the
military road. Possibly one of the leading intellectuals of
his day, Bello formulated many of the theoretical
justifications for Latin American independence. Outliving
most of the military leaders, Bello died of old age in Chile
after a successful career as a scholar and statesman. He left
behind an inspiring set of works calling for Latin
American political and cultural sovereignty.
The liberator of the South was José San Martín
(1778–1850), an Argentine general who led an army made
up of former slaves and poor peasants on a heroic march
across the Andes to defeat the Spanish royalists in Chile at
the Battle of Chacabuco. He then marched on to Lima and
declared independence in July 1821. Others were Bernardo
O’Higgins (1778–1842), San Martín’s subordinate whom
161he left to drive the Spanish from Chile, and Antonio José
de Sucre (1795–1830), Bolívar’s closest lieutenant, who
led the campaign in Bolivia. The Latin American masses
fought with the liberating armies; and even at times with
the Spanish royalists. Their loyalties depended on very
local factors, such as promises of freedom, waivers of
prison or debt sentences, pay, force, the reputation of a
general, personal loyalty, or the promise of food and
clothing. From beginning to end, the liberation proceeded
unevenly, from 1810 when the Creoles of Venezuela
openly defied the Spanish, until the last royalist army was
defeated at Callao (the port serving Lima) in 1826. The
rebellions were ideological, political, and sometimes
personal. When they were over, America was free from
Spain but the continent was in shambles.
In contrast to events in Mexico, where the uprisings began
tumultuously with thousands of poor mestizos and Indians
marching on Spanish garrisons behind the banner of the
Virgin of Guadalupe, the tenor of revolution in Spanish
America proceeded more slowly. The spark came from
Napoleon’s 1807 invasion of Spain and deposition of the
Spanish Crown. In response, many key colonial capitals
formed juntas – local councils or assemblies – to govern in
the absence of the king; or in his name, depending on the
royalist sympathies of the particular junta. For example,
the Montevideo junta, formed in 1808, was loyal to the
king and sought to carry on the monarchy even in the face
of the monarch’s deposition. Conversely, juntas in Lima,
Buenos Aires, Quito, Santiago de Chile, Caracas and other
cities sought to govern autonomously from the Crown, or
at a healthy distance. Most juntas bypassed colonial
officials, changed rules that placed the colonies in
162economic and political subservience to the Crown, and
rolled back measures the colonists most abhorred. They
opened the ports to trade with ships from many countries,
eliminated the sales tax (alcabala), abolished the slave
trade, and ended the Church’s right to exact tribute. In
some areas the power of the Church was dramatically
curtailed, Spanish clergy and officials loyal to the Crown
were expelled, and steps were taken to separate the affairs
of the state from the Church. Both from Spain and from
outposts in the Americas, the loyalists responded. At
places such as Buenos Aires, Asunción, and intensely
royalist Montevideo, they refused to accept the authority of
the new Creole juntas.
For nearly two decades armies fought up and down the
expanse of South America, gaining and losing ground until
final victory. The two best-known liberators, Bolívar and
San Martín, despite differences of approach, attempted to
mold the disparate states of the continent united into a
loose federation. They failed. San Martín resigned his
command and left for self-imposed exile in France after
having been victorious in liberating most of the Southern
Cone. Bolívar went on to help his closest lieutenant,
Antonio de Sucre, win at the battle of Ayacucho in today’s
Peru, but stood by as the latter claimed much of
modern-day Bolivia as his own.
From 1826 to 1828 Bolívar pursued his plan to unite
Spanish America into a federated republic. His attempts to
form a constitution met with opposition from regional
forces, since the battlefield of the independence struggles
was extended over extremely rugged terrain separated by
thousands of miles. At one point Bolívar ruled as dictator
163in his attempt to quell intrigue and splits among and
between the generals who had defeated the Spaniards. This
move proved disastrous, generating as it did even greater
distrust and hostility toward the Liberator. Bolívar, to his
fault, was not a warm and charismatic leader who
engendered great personal loyalty. He could be cold, aloof,
ruthless, and his aristocratic demeanor sowed distrust
among the hardscrabble troops and officers who came up
through the ranks of local armies. Likewise, he appeared to
trust few others, and refused to share power and ultimate
command of the army with San Martín, or anyone else. He
was mismatched with his army of lower-class recruits,
many of whom fought in return for the promise of social
reforms, access to land, abolition of slavery, and an end to
the forced payment of tribute. In 1830 he stepped down
from his post as leader of the constitutional process and
chose to go into exile. Before leaving, however, he fell
sick and died in December, a few months before his 47th
birthday. Even as Bolívar lay dying, he was dealt two
mortal political blows that no doubt undercut his resolve to
live on. Ecuador pulled out of the fragile union he was
attempting to form and Venezuela betrayed him, refusing
even to allow him to return to the country of his birth. In
June Bolívar had sent Antonio Sucre, in a last-ditch effort
to save a unified Gran Colombia, but Sucre was killed by
an unknown assassin, probably a political opponent of the
federation, on his way back to report to Bolívar the news
of his failure. Over the next few years the entire unity plan
dissolved.
At the mid-point of the century Latin America stood in
shambles (Map 3.5). The long and bloody conflict had
exacted a tremendous toll on its people, fragile political
164institutions, and already weak economy, as well as on the
social cohesion of the new states. Trade and
communication was disrupted, mines were flooded and
equipment destroyed, livestock slaughtered or ill-fed and
dispersed. There were few stable governments, no uniform
and trusted currency, inflation was rampant, capital had
disappeared, property was confiscated, and economies lay
in ruins. Apart from Indian villages, the majority of people
lacked titles to land and few non-Indian inhabitants of rural
areas had the skills required to manage their holdings and
restore trade lines to markets. Similar to the train of events
in Haiti after independence, individual peasants and rural
Indian communities attempted to return to the
pre-independence way of life. No central government
capable of uniting the factions of generals emerged, and
the dream of a United States of Latin America dissolved.
After Bolívar’s death, San Martín despaired of leading
recalcitrant Creoles to carry out reforms, such as ending
slavery, dividing land among the peasantry, and
controlling the Church. He left Peru after the fall of Callao,
retired to Europe and never returned to the lands he had
fought to liberate from Spain. Other military commanders
and their Creole allies divided the spoils, and eventually
their strongholds emerged as the countries of Latin
America. For the masses who had fought for independence
against Spanish tyranny, the face of power looked the
same. Whites born in the Americas dictated to the masses,
just as whites born in Spain had done in the past.

165Post-independence Changes in Racial and Gender Status
Women had participated in the independence armies,
moving with the troops, preparing food, sewing and
repairing uniforms. They worked as nurses, messengers,
spies, and sometimes as soldiers (see Box 3.1). Some
women joined the effort out of ideological conviction;
166others did so because they needed protection in the face of
the marauding army of the other side, and many were
forced into sexual servitude against their will. The
economic and political instability that permeated the era
mitigated against steady employment. When men joined
the ranks of the military as a way of earning a wage or
being assured of daily rations, women stayed behind and
took jobs the men vacated, or managed the crops on
landholdings ranging in size from tiny plots to large
estates. As frequently has occurred in times of war, women
filled the gap in production left by men, and in so doing
came away from the war with a heightened sense of
self-worth, stronger incorporation into the national body,
and demands for greater equality. Although nationalist
sentiments and the hardships of battle opened up new roles
for women, including the first murmurings of female
suffrage, at war’s end patriarchy was reasserted. The
fragmented states of the post-colonial era fell under the
governance of powerful male leaders, cutting off any
claims for sharing power with the subordinate classes,
races, and genders that had attempted to carve out a space
for equal treatment under the law.
Box 3.1 1812 Cochabamba
It was on May 27, 1812 that the women of
Cochabamba fought the Spanish army. In
commemoration of their heroism Bolivia today
marks May 27 as Mothers’ Day:
167From Cochabamba, many men have fled. Not one
woman. On the hillside, a great clamor.
Cochabamba’s plebeian women, at bay, fight from
the center of a circle of fire. Surrounded by five
thousand Spaniards, they resist with battered tin
guns and a few arquebuses; and they fight to the
last yell, whose echoes will resound throughout the
long war for independence. Whenever his army
weakens, General Manuel Belgrano will shout
those words which never fail to restore courage and
spark anger. The general will ask his vacillating
soldiers: “Are the women of Cochabamba
present?”

One of the main accomplishments of independence was
the abolition of slavery, everywhere but Brazil, whose
independence from Portugal had not precipitated armed
conflict. Because many slaves had taken advantage of
automatic manumission in return for joining the army of
either Spain or the independence forces, when peace was
declared the system of slavery was far too undermined to
return. Bolívar’s commitment to abolition is said to have
come from his contact in Haiti with Alexandre Sabès
Pétion (1770–1818), a mixed-race ally of General
Dessalines. As president of the southern half of the country
after Dessalines’ death in 1806, with Henri Christophe
168(1767–1820) claiming the northern half, Pétion is known
for his (only partially successful) attempts to distribute
land to the peasants and to establish a democratic
government. Pétion welcomed Bolívar in 1816 as the latter
was returning, destitute, from exile in Jamaica on his way
to the northern coast of South America to relaunch the
campaign. For the seven ships, 250 men, guns and
provisions that Pétion provided Bolívar for his campaign,
the Haitian leader demanded that Bolívar liberate the
slaves in whatever land he took from Spain.
A final accomplishment of the independence struggle was
a new sense of nationalism, or what one might call
“Americanism.” The Creoles no longer saw themselves as
tied to Europe and its institutions of domination, especially
the Church. They enacted laws to separate Church and
state; seize church property; install public, non-religious
educational institutions; and end the practice of forced
tithing for Crown and Church. For the remainder of the
nineteenth century Church and state wrangled over the
latter’s attempts to hold ecclesiastical authority in check
and to formulate a secular doctrine to govern the civil
societies of the new republics.
The Last Holdout of Slavery in Spanish America
From the northern border of Mexico to Tierra del Fuego,
Latin America had thrown off the shackles of colonialism.
Most telling, however, were the places that remained in the
hands of Spain: Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean. In
fact, these valuable sugarproducing islands only entered
into importance, to Spain and to the world economy in
general, as a result of the demise of Haiti. The chaos and
169devastation Haiti endured, and the impoverished state in
which it was left after independence, was sufficient to
consolidate the hold of slavery and colonialism in the
remaining, and nearby, Spanish possessions. In her history
of race and nationalism historian Ada Ferrer summarizes
the sentiments of the Cuban planters as they absorbed the
fate of their counterparts on Saint-Domingue: “Cuba, they
said, would either be Spanish or it would be African; it
would be Spanish, or it would be another Haiti. For those
with the power to decide, the answer came without
hesitation: Cuba would remain a Spanish colony.”12 It
would take Cuba and Puerto Rico until century’s end to
raise the banner of independence, and even then the
struggle would be long, difficult, and ultimately
incomplete. When the war ended in 1898, Cuba and Puerto
Rico found themselves free from Spain but in the grip of a
new power, the United States.
Slavery lasted longer in Cuba and Brazil than in any other
American society, for slightly differing reasons. In Brazil,
slavery went unquestioned until the early nineteenth
century. The debate over slavery that raged in the capitals
of Europe, North America, and in other Latin American
nations went largely unheard in Brazil until several
decades into the century. Up and down the continent
slavery had ended by the mid-nineteenth century as a part
of their struggles for independence from Spain and
following the Civil War in the United States. Abolition in
Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil stalled for several reasons:
the peculiar course of the independence struggle; the
extreme dependence on slaves to carry out all productive
work in these societies; the flexibility in the system,
whereby many slaves obtained their freedom or lived
170separately from owners who rented them out and took a
share of the slave’s wages as compensation; and the
coexistence, especially in the Caribbean, of slavery
alongside Asian indentured servants.
Although the Spanish Court set the date of final abolition
as 1888, slavery in Cuba had ended in practice, if not in
law, two years earlier. Abolition came about, as the
planters had predicted, as a result of the struggle for
independence, but without the fireworks that characterized
the Haitian Revolution. Instead, a remarkable coalition of
whites, free people of color, and ex-slaves fought together
in an army against Spanish colonial forces in three stages
over 30 years, from 1868 until 1898. As historians have
noted, 60 percent of the rank and file and 40 percent of the
commissioned officers in the Cuban independence army
were Afro-descendant. Had Cuba been able to remain
autonomous, and had the US military not intervened and
recolonized the island at the behest of powerful sugar
trusts and politicians, Cuba may well have emerged as a
remarkable multiracial society, governed by a diverse
range of whites, blacks, and people of mixed race,
including a large number of Chinese who had been brought
as indentured servants in the mid-nineteenth century.
Frequently lost in the explanations of the Spanish
American war – which is generally understood as an act of
imperialist aggression engineered by yellow journalists
and powerful industrialists – is the fact that neither the US,
which was entering into the height of its Jim Crow era, nor
Europe, where racist eugenicist theories justified white
colonialism, wanted to allow Cuba to thrive as a successful
multiracial republic. The planter elite clung to their
171colonial status. We will take up the Cuban and Puerto
Rican independence movement in Chapter 5.
Box 3.2 Modern-day “slavery”
Although formal, legally sanctioned,
state-sponsored slavery ceased to exist nearly
everywhere in the world by the end of the
nineteenth century, many workers still live in
conditions so coercive as to be considered a new
“modern” slave system. In 2005 the Brazilian
government estimated that 25,000 people were held
in unfree labor conditions, but independent
observers have placed that number far higher.
Hardly spoken of around the world, nonetheless the
Swiss-based International Labor Organization
calculates that at the beginning of the twenty-first
century 27 million people are held in slave and
“slave-like” conditions, bound to jobs and lands
they cannot leave, tricked, or coerced, sold and
captured into sex-slavery throughout the world.
The largest numbers are in the Middle East,
Pakistan, sub-Saharan Africa, and at least 10,000 in
the United States. Although history has ample
records and analyses of ancient slavery in Greece,
Rome, Egypt, China and much of Africa, along
with the Atlantic slave trade and New World
slavery from the fifteenth through the nineteenth
centuries, very little mention is made of slavery in
the contemporary world, despite the remarkable
172fact that more people are held today in coerced
labor conditions from which they cannot leave than
at any time in history.13
Latin America in a Changing World Order
European merchants eyed warily the developments in
Latin America as conflict turned to peace, and the
independent republics struggled to rebuild. Great Britain’s
influence was strongest in Brazil, because of Portugal’s
traditionally close alliance with Britain. For example, in
1808 the Portuguese court had earned Napoleon’s enmity
by refusing to bar British ships from its ports; the
departure of the House of Braganza to Brazil was carried
out under the protection of the British fleet. When in 1825
Portugal demanded £2 million sterling (equal to about $7
million) as compensation for the loss of its colony, British
banks had secured the loan, thereby sealing the new
nation’s fate in much the same way that Portugal’s had
been sealed by the many agreements tying Portugal to
England since the 1703 Treaty of Methuen.
In response to growing pressure at home, England ended
the transatlantic slave trade in 1830; trading in slaves was
seen as the most abhorrent aspect of slavery by a growing
body of abolitionists making their case before the British
Parliament, in street rallies, and in a barrage of newspaper
articles and pamphlets. England in turn required Brazil to
end the external slave trade in return for favorable
commercial agreements and full recognition of the latter’s
independence. Although the slave trade continued – with
173the full knowledge of the Brazilian government – the
bombardment of ports and seizure of slave ships on the
high seas pushed up the price of slaves, contributing to the
eventual demise of the system. After several years of
back-and-forth negotiating, Brazil finally outlawed the
external slave trade on March 13, 1830. In an attempt to
stem the ongoing trade in contraband slaves the following
year, the government passed a law freeing any slave who
entered Brazil, a rule that was admittedly hard to enforce.
Independence from Spain had fulfilled the dreams of the
prosperous Latin American Creoles. Merchants began to
ship minerals and agricultural products, cotton, sugar,
tobacco, henequen, beef, wool, and other goods out on
British ships, which docked at ports where the British were
installing better facilities, financed by British banks, with
an export–import trade insured by the superior resources
and organization of British financial houses. The planters
and latifundistas saw no reason to wrest trade from the
British, since they profited so handsomely from the
exchange. They called it Progress, or Civilization. The
economies of the newly formed republics, no more than
personal territories carved out by victorious generals in
some cases, were in dire straits. Given this instability,
traditional forms of labor and hierarchy soon re-emerged.
The large estates began to produce for export, relying on
the work of indebted laborers, many of whom returned to
their jobs on the pre-independence haciendas where they
had previously toiled. No longer under the restrictions of
Spanish colonial rule, the new nations began to establish
new markets for their goods.
174England’s close relationship with Portugal, and
subsequently with the independent empire of Brazil as the
latter’s chief export market, had a contradictory effect on
the persistence of slavery. Primarily it was Brazil’s
lucrative trade in slaves, coffee, and other export
commodities that made it an attractive nineteenth-century
ally and neocolonial trading partner for Britain, and one
the great power eagerly nurtured. Britain exerted its
influence in a number of ways, including forcing its own
manufactured goods, especially textiles, onto the Brazilian
consumer – thereby undermining the thriving domestic
textile manufacturing of the colonial period. Paradoxically,
while Britain profited from the sale of cheap cotton, wool,
and minerals from Brazil – all produced with slave labor –
its Parliament was under heavy pressure to end slavery and
the slave trade. After Brazil agreed to shut down its trade
in slaves in 1830, smuggling continued for at least another
two decades and the country accounted for 60 percent of
the slave trade from 1811 until it finally came to an end in
1852. Cuba and Puerto Rico absorbed the bulk of the
slaves coming into Spanish America; Cuba’s slave trade
continued until 1867. Thus British citizens were able to
purchase inexpensive sugar, coffee, and textiles while
denouncing slavery, the practice that kept commodity
prices low. The situation is reminiscent of modern-day
campaigns in the US and Europe to end slave-like labor
conditions in sweatshops, while consumers continue to
expect low-priced consumer goods.
Conclusion
The struggle for independence in Latin America and the
Caribbean originated with the 1791 slave revolt in the
175French colony that would become Haiti, and swept through
Mexico in fits and starts, culminating in 1821. The armies
of the great Liberators, San Martín, Bolívar, Sucre, and
others had secured the independence of the rugged,
geographically, politically and culturally fragmented
Spanish American territories, finally pulling in a reluctant
Peru in 1824. Cuba, one of the most important colonies
and the jewel of the Caribbean holdings, along with the
smaller island of Puerto Rico, remained loyal to Spain
until the end of the nineteenth century. Independence
arrived in Brazil through the most circuitous of routes,
ending in the proclamation of an independent empire in
1822. Brazil’s status as a monarchy meant that it did not
suffer from the regional fragmentation that plagued the
former Spanish colonies. There were a few secessionist
movements in some areas, but for the most part Brazil
maintained political cohesion, under the rule of
slaveholding elites, throughout the nineteenth century.
As Eduardo Galeano points out, independence did very
little to improve the lot of the masses because the system
that began with the first conquistadores, based on
exploitation of the many by the few and centered on large
landholdings, remained in place. Brazil worked slaves on
its sugar plantations; Argentine estancieros raised herds of
cattle and sheep; Peru had mines and sugar plantations;
Mexico had livestock, mines, henequen (rope), sugar and
silver, among a wide variety of export products. Vast
estates dotted the Latin American landscape. Fortunes
survived the wars of independence intact. Inequalities were
not swept away in the fires of revolution, despite the
promises of freedom that the Liberators and generals used
to entice the masses onto the battlefield. The
176nineteenth-century debate pitted the legacies of a
semi-feudal colonial order – based on corporate holdings,
church and state protection of Indian rights – against the
emerging doctrine of liberalism rooted in a belief in free
trade, low tariffs, and individual rights. Although
championed as the epitome of freedom, liberalism did not
necessarily benefit the majority, especially Indians.
Independence had left in its wake an economically
devastated, politically fractured, and culturally divided
continent under pressure to build autonomous states. The
postcolonial world stretched ahead, serving as the field
upon which the struggle over class, ethnic, gender, racial,
and religious tensions would take place.
1774
Fragmented Nationalisms
From his deathbed Simón Bolívar is said to have declared:
“America is ungovernable.” Whether the Liberator’s
pessimism stemmed from the remote distances that
separated the population of the immense continent or the
disparate cultures, languages, ethnicities, and races of its
people, or simply the lack of political unity, is not clear.
Certainly any or all of these factors were sufficient to give
pause to anyone hoping to unite the now sovereign
territory. Vast expanses separated the old colonial cities,
while new trading centers were geographically remote
from one another, separated by impassable mountains,
high deserts, and arid plains, linked by unnavigable
waterways and rudimentary roads. All of these factors
were to some extent responsible for the fragmented states
that emerged in the wake of the wars of independence.
This chapter examines nation building during the
nineteenth century, with a focus on certain influential
political, economic, and cultural forces and trends.
Liberating Latin America from Spain was simpler than
governing the independent states. Bolívar died on his way
into exile in Europe; San Martín died in exile in Paris,
never returning to Argentina; while José Gervasio Artigas
(1764–1850), a reformist general who had led an army of
cowboys in pursuit of land and rights for the peasants on
the Uruguay and Argentine border, died in exile in
Paraguay. The pitiful disillusion experienced by the
“Liberators” has served as rich material for Latin
178American novelists, but their failures sealed the unenviable
fate of the continent’s masses.
Searching for Political and Economic Unity
In Latin America, as anywhere in the world, the
state-building process did not proceed down the same path
nor conform to a single mold. Thus post-colonial Peru or
Mexico, Argentina or Colombia were not simply failed
variations of the nation-building project long underway in
Europe. Florencia Mallon notes that in Europe the concept
of freedom, especially the notion of “freeborn men,” was
shaped in the context of the lack of freedom – colonialism
and slavery – that Europe had imposed on subjugated
populations around the globe. If Europeans championed
“universal” equality and liberty of ideas for themselves, or
if they took pride in their “citizenship” as members of a
nation, they barred access to freedom and democracy for
much of the rest of the world, and most definitely to the
people in those areas they directly controlled.
It is appropriate that students understand that many of the
people from all social classes, ethnic and racial groups
who participated in the independence wars felt they were
deserving of freedom, equality, and the exercise of
sovereignty. Others, however, in both Europe and
America, did not assume that such rights as liberty,
equality, and fraternity should be extended to the masses.
Thus, we cannot assume that the failure to consolidate
democratic reforms in the new nations was solely the fault
of their peoples. The fate of post-independence Haiti
stands as a case in point, especially the disdain with which
the so-called champions of Enlightenment rights in the
179United States and Europe showed toward the former slaves
when the latter expressed the same aspirations. According
to the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Enlightenment
thinkers, liberty and equality were concepts reserved for
Europeans, and ultimately white Americans, but denied to
the majority of people of color in both North and South
America. The status of elite women complicated the terms
of citizenship everywhere, causing the matter of women’s
rights to develop as something of a wild card. As we will
see in this and later chapters, gender equality was an
inconsistent and incomplete concept in independent
America, just as it had been during the colonial era. White
women, for example, could have great power over black
slaves or matters of their own household, while at the same
time have no real voice in the management of the broader
society.
Economically, independence affected disparate regions
differently. Previous trade routes disappeared, and new
towns in secondary regions with new population centers
emerged. These areas had come into existence as a result
of the encampment of roaming revolutionary armies that
often included women and children, and sometimes entire
communities. Towns grew up near the long supply lines
stretching between preexisting villages or from urban areas
to distant front lines. Some of the recently formed towns
shut down once the army left, while others hung on and
morphed into new communities. European and North
American demand for sugar, coffee, cacao, and hides had
increased dramatically by mid-century, but it was this
external trade that the new republics were most unprepared
to handle. They had no ships, and port facilities were
inadequate; even a supply of hard currency was hard to
180come by. British, and some other foreign and domestic
entrepreneurs, however, were anxious to step in and supply
the means to further develop Latin America’s trade.
New World “Feudalism”
A key feature of post-colonial life that exemplified the
nature of class relationships in Latin America was the
progressive concentration of wealth in a few hands,
especially wealth measured in the form of land. In fact, it
was in the nineteenth century that the concept of the
latifundia, or very large tracts of land, shifted into the
vernacular of the newly independent nations. In much of
Latin America land tenure became even more unequal
following independence. Land granted to members of the
army in reward for service usually ended up in the hands
of speculators and powerful local bosses. The latter
operated as regional rulers and were referred to as
caudillos, literally meaning “strongmen.” In the backlands
of Brazil they were often called “colonels,” since they
wielded the authority of military chiefs, despite their
civilian status. But many caudillos were, in fact, former
military commanders who derived their prestige and
following from the independence wars and the disputes
that broke out during the period of instability following the
treaties that ended formal hostilities.
Caudillo strongmen came in many varieties: some were
more progressive than others, for example José Gregorio
Monegas (1791–1858) and his brother José Tadeo
Monegas (1785–1868) alternately held the presidency of
Venezuela in the 1850s and abolished slavery in 1854,
more out of expediency and an (ultimately unsuccessful)
181attempt to win political support than from a genuine
commitment to social equality. A few caudillos were
known for their nationalist programs, building
infrastructure and attempting to strengthen local
enterprises. Nonetheless, the general stamp of
authoritarianism marked the caudillo era. Just as the
precise terms for large landholdings varied, so too did the
extent to which the caudillos controlled their subordinates.
In sum, uneven relations of production characterized the
era: indebted laborers, called debt peons, produced goods
on large rural estates, laboring under conditions more akin
to feudalism than capitalism.
Although nineteenth-century estates were self-contained,
they were not necessarily self-sufficient. Inventories of
haciendas in the interior of Argentina, the remote
countryside of Mexico, and many places in between
revealed the presence of large quantities of imported
luxury and essential goods. According to Argentine
historian Carlos Mayo, remote nineteenth-century
estancias on the pampas had stocks of imported silver and
linens from Europe, perfumes and soaps, furniture and
household accessories, all of which had long been assumed
to be present in wealthy homes in capital cities – but not
on distant estates located inland. A single owner or family,
employing laborers working at subsistence-level wages,
controlled the archetypical estate through autocratic rule.
Unlike Cuba and Brazil, labor on the large estates of most
of Latin America was free in name, but seldom in practice.
Together the latifundio system and minifundios
(smallholdings where peasants worked their own plots and
sold their produce to the latifundista or at local markets)
kept the majority of rural people in conditions of perpetual
182impoverishment and created a landscape in which
large-scale landowners exercised near complete control
over rural resources, especially water, and the entire
production process (Figure 4.1).
If a map of landholdings in mid-nineteenth century Latin
America existed, it would show little or no change from
the colonial period. In 1830 in Argentina, for example, 21
million acres of public land was taken over by 500 private
individuals, giving them each an estate of about 42,000
acres. By the mid-nineteenth century the Anchorena family
controlled 1.5 million acres. Similarly, in northern Mexico
the Sanchez Navarro family consolidated and expanded
holdings during the independence wars and the long period
of strife that followed. By 1848 they controlled 17
haciendas encompassing more than 16 million acres of
land. An English traveler to Mexico wrote in awe of the
incredible wealth of local landowners:
Figure 4.1 Plantation of Senator Vergueiro with house,
barns, storage sheds and a row of slave cabins, ca. 1800s.
(James C. Fletcher and D. P. Kidder, Brazil and the
Brazilians)
183This beautiful hacienda is 30 leagues in length and 17 in
width [about l,800 square miles], containing in this great
space the productions of every climate, from the fir-clad
mountains on a level with the volcano of Toluca, to the
fertile plains which produce corn and maize; and lower
down fields of sugar cane and other productions of the
tropics.1
These immense estates became self-contained enclaves
employing carpenters, blacksmiths, bakers, seamstresses,
candle-makers, mechanics, and even their own priest or
estate chaplain. Wealthy landowners became a fixture on
the Latin American landscape, ruling entire provinces
through their own personal armies, enforcing their own
laws, collecting taxes from rural peasants who were tied to
the land, in debt, illiterate, and ignorant of any rights that
distant constitutions might have won for them. The
caudillos ruled as patriarchs, making all decisions,
dispensing “justice,” determining what was produced,
when and by whom. Most maintained city homes, where
184their wives and families lived for a part of the year and to
which they made occasional trips. Alone in the
countryside, far from the restraining eye of the Church,
“polite society” and their families, caudillo patriarchs took
advantage of young women on their estates, sometimes to
cook and keep house, or to serve in whatever ways they
might desire.
Most workers on plantations and estates did not leave that
world their entire lives. They never saw a government
official, a city, a church outside the chapel on the estate;
never went to school or learned the basic rights of
citizenship. Even those who had been freed as payment for
serving in the independence armies were confined in a
status close to enslavement in Bolivia, Colombia, and rural
areas of Argentina once the revolution ended. The majority
was bound to the land by virtue of debt to the patrón, lack
of education and ignorance of life away from the estate, as
well as the absence of marketable skills that would allow a
worker and his family to make a living in the city.
Considering that in the nineteenth century the majority of
Latin America’s population lived far from urban areas,
such isolation was the norm for all but a comparative few.
In Mexico, for example, 90 percent of the country’s eight
million people dwelled in rural areas at the end of the
independence wars. Cut off and ignored, the peasantry had
little knowledge of, or concern for, events outside their
villages, leading lives consumed by desperate attempts to
find enough to eat and conserve the resources of a bare
livelihood. By the end of the nineteenth century, only 10
percent of Mexican peasants were literate, and the life
expectancy of a rural worker stood at 24 years.
185Much of the information we have on life in Mexico comes
to us from the diaries of the Marquesa Frances Calderón de
la Barca (1804–82) who traveled through Mexico in the
1840s and recorded her observations about Mexican life in
both rural and urban areas. Born in Scotland, Calderón de
la Barca, known as Fanny, and her family moved to
Washington DC in the 1830s, where she met and married
the Spanish Ambassador to the US, Angel Calderón de la
Barca. She traveled with him when he became
Ambassador to Mexico in 1839. Her journals and letters
were compiled into a book, Life in Mexico, published in
Boston in 1843 by author, journalist, and Mexico observer
William H. Prescott. In 1861, after the death of her
husband, Fanny became the governess and companion to
the Spanish royal family, and was eventually given the title
of marquesa.
One of Calderón de la Barca’s comments explains the
reasons why in the midnineteenth century many Mexicans,
not just the poor, may have seemed uneducated:
There are no circulating libraries in Mexico. Books are at
least double the price that they are in Europe. There is no
diffusion of useful knowledge amongst the people; neither
cheap pamphlets nor cheap magazines written for their
amusement or instruction; but this is less owing to want of
attention to their interests on the part of many good and
enlightened men, than to the unsettled state of the country;
for the blight of civil war prevents the best systems from
ripening.2
Depending on the country, era, and/or geographic region
and terrain, the center of the landed estate was the Big
186House, the casa grande or hacienda. It varied in size,
degree of luxury, and accoutrements of wealth and fashion
according to the region and prosperity of the landowner. In
Brazil it was typically a two-story dwelling, but those in
Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and other places in Latin
America were sometimes rambling one-story structures.
The house had separate parlors to greet guests, large dining
rooms and, occasionally, ballrooms. There were many
bedrooms, both for the family and to accommodate
travelers who came and stayed on as guests of the patrón
and his family. The ground floor had a pantry and a
kitchen – although kitchens were sometimes separate from
the house to contain the smells of butchering game and
preparing food. Estates, especially those far from
municipalities, often boasted their own chapel where a
resident member of the clergy held services in which the
family, slaves, and laborers partook according to their
station. Many homes had separate or attached small houses
or rooms for storing linens, kitchen supplies, and goods for
furnishing and cleaning the house, as well as storage areas
for food, wine, and the produce of the estate. The houses
generally had a large porch or veranda from which the
patrón oversaw his estate, greeted guests, and meted out
punishment and reward to laborers. Indeed, much of the
business of the estate was conducted from the veranda.
Standing amidst other buildings that serviced the estate,
the Big House represented the pinnacle of power in rural
society, and symbolized the authority the patriarch wielded
over his environs. In stark contrast, workers were housed
in small shacks near the fields, barns or behind the Big
House, usually adjacent to their places of employment.
Entire families lived in a single room in ramshackle
187buildings the workers themselves constructed and
maintained with whatever scrap materials they could
salvage.
While systems of production in urban areas have changed
dramatically over the centuries, large landed estates and
the coerced labor force they employ have remained a
permanent fixture in many countries. The legacy of the
colonial and immediate post-colonial period is apparent
today: 60 percent of rural Mexican households are
landless, as are 66 percent of Colombians and 70 percent
of Brazilians. In Chile, a country that underwent a number
of land reforms in the twentieth century, and continuing
into the twenty-first, most of the fertile central valley
remains in the hands of three percent of the country’s
landowners. The latifundistas, whose modern-day
embodiment in some areas (especially Brazil and parts of
Mexico) is corporate agribusiness, have been able to
influence national politics and prevent meaningful
enforcement of reforms for those who work the land.
Post-independence Politics
Political alignments and realignments left a permanent
imprint on the post-colonial era. In most studies of Latin
American history the post-independence decades have
been viewed as a time of perpetual upheaval. As Peter
Bakewell puts it in his comprehensive history of Latin
America: “although it would be foolish, and wrong, to
dismiss the postindependence decades as simply a period
of indescribable chaos, political calm was notably absent
from a time when it was much needed.”3 Historically,
neither the process of forging a new nation, nor of creating
188a sense of loyalty to that nation – nationalism – can be
seen as following a single ideological trajectory.
Nationalism is at home on the left or the right; embraced
by the radical freethinker or the conservative, by the
forwardlooking reformer or the backward-looking
traditionalist. Latin American nationalism and particular
definition of national identity varied over time and place,
rested on competing notions of power, and depended on
the rights accorded to, or taken by, Indians, blacks,
mestizos, and mixed-race people. In the hands of caudillos
one or another racial group was restricted or promoted, one
or another conception of manliness or femininity stood as
the ideal, alongside standard symbols and rituals – flags,
anthems, language, and customs – that drew the
community together. An emerging authoritarianism,
epitomized by the personalist caudillos, stamped the
post-independence era as one of excessive individual greed
and power, based on distrust of foreigners and foreign
governments. Some caudillos were self-serving,
backward-looking, authoritarian, and anti-intellectual,
while others were progressive and reform-minded. Some
caudillos abolished slavery, instituted educational
structures, built railroads and other transport systems, and
sought to forge economic units capable of driving hard
bargains with entrepreneurs representing European and US
firms. Because the caudillos did not fit into a single mold
nor represent a single political vision, and because they
tended to rise to power through networks of personal
loyalty, some historians have characterized them as
“populists.” Admittedly populism is a frustratingly vague
and imprecise label that has meant different things in
different historical periods, but the flexibility of the term
may help to define the caudillo. As a “strongman” the
189caudillo tolerated little or no opposition, and relied on
armed strength to maintain his power (see Box 4.1). As a
“populist,” the caudillo drew his power from those who
were loyal to him, many of whom were small producers
beholden to his beneficence and the patronage he doled out
to ensure their loyalty.
Box 4.1 Gabriel García Márquez on the ultimate
caudillo
The Colombian novelist, famous for his absurdist
portrayals of Latin American tyrants, refers in this
excerpt from his Nobel Prize acceptance speech to
the antics, and savagery, of a few leading military
men:
Our independence from Spanish domination did
not put us beyond the reach of madness. General
Antonio López de Santana, three times dictator of
Mexico, held a magnificent funeral for the right leg
he had lost in the so-called Pastry War. General
Gabriel García Moreno ruled Ecuador for sixteen
years as an absolute monarch; at his wake, the
corpse was seated on the presidential chair, decked
out in full-dress uniform and a protective layer of
medals. General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez,
the theosophical despot of El Salvador who had
thirty thousand peasants slaughtered in a savage
massacre, invented a pendulum to detect poison in
his food, and had streetlamps draped in red paper
190to defeat an epidemic of scarlet fever. The statue to
General Francisco Morazán erected in the main
square of Tegucigalpa is actually one of Marshal
Ney, purchased at a Paris warehouse of
second-hand sculptures.
From Gabriel García Márquez, “The Solitude of
Latin America” (Nobel Lecture, December 8,
1982).
Argentina and the Tyrants
The archetypical caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas
(1793–1877) rose to power in Argentina in 1829 and ruled
until 1854, drawing his support from the estancieros south
of Buenos Aires, the capital. Rosas began his career in the
military, following a path common to many ambitious
young men active in the drive for independence. Cousin to
the wealthy landholding Anchorena family, Rosas’s
military career and influence helped to build the dynasty’s
resources in the province. Rosas is known for developing a
mini-government and system of authority on his estate that
eventually spread to the surrounding region. He demanded
absolute respect, obedience, loyalty, and diligent work
from the Indians, mixed-race debt peons, and gauchos
(cowboys) in return for employment on his ranch or
membership in his personal army. Rosas rejected attempts
from the capital to centralize authority, modernize and
build the export market, or enforce other measures
intended to serve the country as a whole. Although he
sometimes expressed staunch adherence to a federalized
191system and local control, Rosas was mostly concerned
with absolute authority centralized in himself and those
loyal to him. In 1828 he began a guerrilla war against the
country’s leadership and eventually launched a successful
assault on the capital, backed by an army of gauchos,
peasant militiamen, and assorted vagrants he had
mobilized into a fighting force. By the end of 1829 he
controlled the governorship of Buenos Aires province, a
post he used as a steppingstone to leadership of Argentina
that he held until his defeat and exile to England in early
1852.
Over his more than two decades of rule, Rosas epitomized
caudillismo. After using rural forces from the estancias to
bring himself to power, he sent them back to the land from
which they had come and relied instead on the regular
army, paramilitaries who did his extra-legal bidding, and
the police and law enforcement bureaucracy. Initially he
attempted to win support from domestic enterprises and
artisans by imposing strict duties on imported goods in
hopes of reviving national industry. The effort failed,
forcing him to lift the ban on essential imports, especially
textiles, and open the door to British manufactures in order
to meet Argentina’s consumer demand. Rosas maintained
control of the legislative branch, denying it resources and
ensuring a rubber stamp for his many edicts; the legislature
served mainly as window-dressing for foreign visitors and
dignitaries. Rosas maintained his popularity through
patronage and tight control of the press and organs of
public relations, but mainly he relied on repression: jailing,
exiling, or killing those who opposed him. This method,
particularly his ironfisted rule over Buenos Aires, the
export–import market, the police, and the military allowed
192the general a monopoly hold over the seat of national
power for nearly 20 years – but it did not ensure peace
throughout the country.
Writer Domingo Sarmiento captured the rivalry and
jealousy among estancieros, as well as the discontent
among liberal, cosmopolitan urban dwellers, in the epic
chronicle Facundo, published in 1845 and later translated
as Life in the Argentine Republic in the Days of the
Tyrants; or Civilization and Barbarism. Sarmiento
(1811–88) used the character of Juan Facundo Quiroga as
the archetypical barbaric caudillo. Although Sarmiento
described the backwardness of the rural caudillo, his
stereotype extended to the landless peasant as well, casting
a racist pall over the intelligence of the rural dweller in a
classic “blame the victim” account. Rosas certainly
derived support from fellow caudillos and a segment of the
rural poor, but also from urban merchants and complacent
legislators, who often profited from his authoritarian rule.
By the late 1840s and early 1850s Rosas’s authority was
under threat from estancieros in other parts of the country
who desired better access to regional markets and local
shipping lines, as opposed to the funneling of all trade
through the port of Buenos Aires. The period was almost a
repeat of the call for free trade and an end to the colonial
monopoly that had galvanized independence forces and
local strongmen a half-century earlier. In 1852 Rosas
found himself under attack politically and militarily. He
lost to an invading army comprised of forces from Brazil
and Uruguay, in addition to rival regional armies within
Argentina itself. The British, who had benefited from
Rosas’s reliance on English monetary support in return for
193assured British control of the export/import market,
hurried him to a ship and into exile in England, where he
eventually died.
Populist Caudillismo: Paraguay and Bolivia
Rosas’s career was a case study in caudillismo, a
phenomenon that relied on outside support from largely
foreign financial and mercantile interests. It likewise
illustrates that the privilege of liberalism in Europe was
anchored in colonial and neocolonial authoritarianism,
despite the self-righteousness and moral superiority
claimed over much of the rest of the world. Nothing
demonstrates that contradiction better than a comparison
between the life, career, and eventual fate of Juan Manuel
Rosas and that of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in
Paraguay. Francia governed Paraguay from 1811 to his
death in 1840, a period that coincided with caudillismo in
Argentina and elsewhere in Latin America. Although
sometimes included in the list of strongman rulers of the
era, Francia used his power to attempt to establish a very
different form of society, based on communal principles
and local control rather than centralized authoritarianism.
Sometimes counted among the dictators of his era,
contemporary history has presented a revised view, seeing
Francia as an honest, populist leader, who promoted
sovereign economic prosperity in war-torn Paraguay. An
austere man, simply dressed, modest, efficient, a Doctor of
Theology, the Scottish travelers John Parish Robertson and
William Parish observed that Francia had the respect of all
parties; that he “never would defend an unjust cause; while
he was ever ready to take the part of the poor and the weak
against the rich and the strong.”4
194Throughout the colonial period Paraguay was a backwater
of the empire, the people there a mixture of Guaraní
Indians and early Spanish settlers who for generations
lived a fairly simple agricultural existence. After
independence land that had belonged to the Church and the
Spanish state reverted to the government. Rather than use
it for himself as the other liberators had done, Francia
established state ranches and rented out the land to those
willing to till it for a nominal fee, aiming to rebuild the
communal Indian society that had existed in Paraguay
before the arrival of European settlers. Shunning the favors
of the landed elite, the Catholic Church, and foreign
investors, Francia used his authority to rearrange society
according to the demands of the poor. He nationalized the
Church, abolished the tithe, declared religious freedom,
and put the clergy on the government payroll. Allowing
working and landless peasants the opportunit to earn a
living on the state-run estancias angered the estancieros,
who had long relied on local peasants as a cheap and ready
source of labor. Francia also closed down municipal
councils that were in the hands of the traditional landed
elite, or severely restricted their authority, but allowed
local councils to continue in areas where small producers,
artisans, skilled and unskilled laborers were in the
majority. He established state-run iron and textile works,
livestock and small handicraft industries, from which a
wide swath of the ordinary population derived a modest
living.
It was Francia’s disregard for wealthy landowners,
merchants, and the Church, and his interference with the
paternalistic, all-encompassing power of the ruling elite
that sparked opposition to his policies. He was accused of
195anti-clericalism for curbing the absolute authority of the
Church, but he actually used state funds to construct new
churches, support religious festivals, and tend cemeteries.
He likewise ordered a state takeover of the management of
social welfare services (such as orphanages, hospitals, and
care for the indigent), which had previously been under the
auspices of the Church and the beneficence of the local
elite. Moreover, under Francia, much to the dislike of
powerful Argentine estancieros, Paraguay prospered. A
fairly lively trade maintained through an overland route to
Buenos Aires. If the old-line Spanish elite and Catholic
hierarchy denounced Francia for his dictatorial treatment
of them, the majority of Paraguayans cheered his
measures. Never having received any particular support or
benefit from the established ruling classes, and having
suffered under the burden of high tithes to a clergy that
required payment for sacraments and burial plots in
Catholic cemeteries, the mass of Paraguayans found in
Francia a sympathetic and honest leader.
At the time of Francia’s death in 1840, Paraguay’s
prosperity was also linked to its policy of vigilant
neutrality toward its large and powerful neighbors:
Argentina and Brazil. Subsequent administrations weakly
followed Francia’s path, expending efforts to expand
railroad and telegraph lines, upgrade the educational
system, and renovate the capital city of Asunción. But in a
particularly ill-conceived move, Francisco Solano López
(1826–70), president from 1862 to 1870, interceded on the
side of neighboring Uruguay and declared war on
Argentina and then Brazil. After a trip to France as a
young man, López apparently became enthralled with
Napoleon’s exploits and fancied himself the “Napoleon of
196South America.” Both were military men, but the
comparison pretty much stopped there. López led
thousands of soldiers to their death in a futile and senseless
war against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, who formed
what was known as the “Triple Alliance” and unleashed
armies that ravaged tiny Paraguay from 1864 to 1870. At
the behest of powerful merchants, the British government
financed the war, in part out of fear that Paraguayan
economic independence might prove contagious. Brazil,
Uruguay, and Argentina did the dirty work, waging a war
of extermination against Paraguay and its people. In six
years untold numbers of Indians were eliminated; 90
percent of the male population in the country between the
ages of 14 and 65 was killed, and Paraguay lay prostrate.
Any semblance of the prosperity and independence
initiated by Francia was destroyed.
Some historians argue that López was a David fighting the
Goliath of his larger and more powerful neighbors, but
most conclude that he led Paraguay into a war that it could
never win, and which nearly destroyed it. Indisputably,
López resorted to the most brutal tactics, wiping out any
sign of opposition among his countrymen, including his
own family and closest advisors. Thousands died in battle,
but hundreds more were tortured and killed by López and
his henchmen in his paranoid pursuit of personal glory.
While Paraguay suffered greater losses than any of the
other Southern Cone countries, the War of the Triple
Alliance probably benefited England the most. British
traders profited handsomely from the destruction of
competition from domestic producers in Uruguay,
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay as the countries
197squandered valuable human and industrial resources on a
senseless war. In the name of economic liberalism, Britain
dealt the final blow to the remnants of Francia’s populism
and assured for its own burgeoning working class and
hungry factories on the other side of the Atlantic a ready
supply of hides, dried beef, wool, and agricultural goods.
Manuel Isidoro Belzú (1808–65), who governed Bolivia
from 1848 until 1855, bore some similarities to Francia. A
populist caudillo, Belzú attempted to modernize a small,
landlocked country by dividing the nation’s wealth and
rewarding the work of the poor and dispossessed. His
efforts earned him admiration from the masses and enmity
from wealthy Creoles. During the seven years he held the
presidency, Belzú instigated protectionist economic
policies to defend small, indigenous producers and enacted
a nationalist mining code that retained the nation’s
resources in the hands of Bolivian companies – thus
provoking the ire of influential British shipping and
mining interests. Despite his popularity in many sectors,
Belzú had many powerful enemies (he supposedly
survived over 40 assassination attempts), many of whom
wanted to destroy the state-run projects that benefited a
nationalist program, but likewise improved the public
sphere on which the country’s poor were reliant.
Like Francia, Belzú was attracted to communal,
state-sponsored, social welfare projects that struck a
responsive chord with Indians in particular, since
communalism was more representative of indigenous
values than the private property and international trade
proposals favored by urban Creoles and British merchants.
Belzú left office in 1855, after presiding over the first
198civilian census in Bolivia’s history. He remained abroad
and out of the public limelight for several years, but began
to consider returning to the presidency in 1861, only to be
gunned down by one of his rivals. Francia’s policies
endured longer than Belzú’s, probably because the
former’s were based on a more fundamental reordering of
Paraguayan society. Although attempting to enact a similar
program, Belzú was unable to create a lasting legacy, and
his populist programs largely died with him.
After Caudillismo
The personalist nature of caudillismo worked against the
long-term social changes required to lay the foundations of
a flourishing civil society for two reasons. It imposed a
tradition of authoritarianism, and thereby set the stage for
subsequent rebellion as the only way to eliminate powerful
dictators. Whether the caudillo improved the lot of his
people (like Francia and Belzú) or stole from and abused
the people and the lands he governed (like Rosas and
López) he did not alter the undemocratic form of
governance inherited from the colonial era. The
widespread emergence of caudillismo postponed and
prevented the construction of social institutions
accountable to the citizenry and managed by capable
experts – legislators, intellectuals, entrepreneurs. Thus
caudillismo may matter as much for what it forestalled –
independent democratic institutions – as for the legacy of
personal strongman rule it embodied.
Caudillismo filled the vacuum left by colonial rule, serving
as a bridge between political and economic power, on the
one hand, and personal, kinship-based cultural
199arrangements, on the other. The best of the populist
caudillos, the “good patriarch,” claimed prestige and
obtained the trust of followers on the basis of his
willingness to confront outsiders and anyone he perceived
as endangering or exploiting the village, the region, or the
entire nation (depending on the extent of his influence).
Rosas, for example, opportunistically denounced British
financiers and entrepreneurs as interlopers and purveyors
of dangerous foreign influences, while at the same time
relying heavily on support from the British government to
suppress internal opposition.
Secondly, caudillismo existed hand in hand with
regionalism, manifested in the persistence of isolated,
parochial local rule. Historians speak of the republiquetas,
or “little republics,” that punctuated the continental
landscape in the nineteenth century, transforming large
estates into politically autonomous entities. Geographically
dispersed settlements allowed local strongmen to evolve
into national leaders, establishing a pattern of rule that
characterized – or plagued – much of Latin America
throughout the twentieth century. The situation was far
from Bolívar’s dream of a United States of South America
and tragically remote from the goal of nurturing an active
citizenry that would determine the course of the
continent’s future. Moreover, the small size of some of the
republiquetas made them vulnerable to the overpowering
influence of foreign investors. Neocolonial economic
relations were established on the foundation of local,
isolated – and often, tyrannical – political formations.
Thirdly, the post-independence era witnessed important
alterations in the sovereign status of indigenous
200communities, as well as in the demographic and cultural
influence of non-whites in relation with whites. If
caudillismo was personalist and paternal, its intersection
with liberalism led to a shrinking of the safety net that had
protected Indians under colonial rule. Never a consistently
uniform ideology, nineteenth-century liberalism trumpeted
individual choice, freedom of thought and speech, the rule
of law, and adherence to a market economy. Obviously the
authoritarianism of caudillo rule was inconsistent with
many of the founding principles of liberal thought,
especially free and open elections. On the other hand,
liberalism favored aggressive free-market tactics and
accommodated the rugged caudillo, under whose rule
indigenous communal towns came under attack.
Creoles and their nineteenth-century descendants asserted
their power over people of color who made up the majority
of Latin America’s population. The percentage of white to
non-white (indigenous, African and Afro-descendant,
mestizo, and casta) varied widely from country to country
in the nineteenth century, as it still does today. In the latter
half of the century two major social changes affected the
pre-independence racial balance. On the one hand,
improved living conditions in urban areas, including
sanitation and health care, combined with better diet, led to
population growth. On the other hand, European
immigration contributed to both population increase and to
mestizaje, or race mixture. Both of these trends are
considered in more detail in later chapters; here we
examine changes in racial composition, the impact of the
wars of independence on the racial make-up of the new
nations, the role of race in the development of national
201identity, and changes in the racial balance of power in the
new social order.
Finally, caudillismo exemplified classic patriarchal
relations, according to which men ruled over their families
and communities in a form that was elsewhere dissolving
into what political theorist Carole Pateman terms the
“brotherhood of men.”5
In northern Europe by the end of
the seventeenth century, the rigid command of fathers over
sons that had prevailed in the medieval era began to give
way to a looser social contract of undifferentiated male
authority (which could also include powerful female
monarchs) over all institutions of the social order. Late
nineteenth-century Latin America underwent a similar
process; it remained a patriarchal society, especially in the
countryside, where a specific man was all-powerful. In
succeeding generations the single patriarch/ caudillo,
immortalized in the writings of Gabriel García Márquez,
Miguel Asturias, Isabel Allende, Rosario Ferre and other
novelists, gave way to a restructured patriarchy in which
social institutions – the economy, politics, religion, and
rules governing social behavior – persisted under
masculine authority. The post-independence world
combined rigid patriarchy in the countryside with the
emerging rule of the more modern “brotherhood of men”
in urban areas. Nevertheless, it bears mention that such
male domination, personalist or institutional, was, and is,
complex and in no way implies that women did not on
occasion play the demagogue, nor that their influence was
not strong, especially as guardians of “acceptable” social
conventions.
Race, Race Mixture, and Liberalism
202Liberalism and its attendant principles of free trade,
political sovereignty, and protection of property had varied
effects on racial balance and race relations. Latin
America’s population has long been divided by race and
ethnicity, both of which are socially constructed categories
that have undergone many definitions throughout history.
Therefore, as understanding of race and ethnicity changed
over time, separating people and communities for unique
and differing reasons (religion, language, physical
characteristics, social conditions), the process of defining
“race” became increasingly difficult. Despite the fact that
terms such as “racial difference,” “racism,” “racial
oppression,” and “color blindness” are widely used, it
would be hard to provide a definition of race that would
stand the test of historical change. The Spanish and
Portuguese explorers of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries embraced the biblical premise that all people
were descended from Adam and Eve and therefore
comprised one race. Africans, who the Iberians knew well
from long contact with North Africa, were thought to have
descended from Noah’s son Ham, and bore the curse of his
outcast. In this case scripture, not skin color, determined
the difference. Some Native American groups in regions
that are today the United States and Canada assumed that a
Creator had devised different races for various parts of the
universe, placing each in a specific corner of the world (or
their known world), while some Mesoamerican
pre-Columbian groups believed that the Creator had
developed humans in a process of trial and error, with
some of the “errors” taking up residence in the world as
different racial types. For centuries scientists debated
whether race developed as a geographical adaptation or,
conversely, was an expression of pre-existing adaptations
203in people who had been cast asunder because of their
violation of a religious doctrine, such as being cast from
ancient Babel. In summary, what race actually meant in
one society or another can be hard to nail down.
Nineteenth-century scientific debate revolved around the
importance of natural selection, placing racial and ethnic
difference within a hierarchy of fitness, and used specific
characteristics such as skin color and hair texture – as
opposed to height, weight, eye and hair color or any of the
hundreds of other ways people differ physically from each
other – as scientific determinants of race. Perception, or
what people see in one another, has also changed over
time. Early in the nineteenth century Irish immigrants to
North America were considered another race, and were
even seen as black. Today in parts of Belfast in Northern
Ireland, Protestants and Catholics refuse to venture onto
the “wrong” side of Falls Road, because the residents of
each side see a difference, ascribed with racial
connotations, that is completely invisible to outsiders.
Hence, as notions of race have varied over time and place,
people have perceived race in myriad ways. Obviously,
drawing racial lines has been one of the most contortionist
enterprises humans have undertaken; if it had not been so
destructive, one might find it laughable. But the genocide
of Jews, Armenians, Tutsis, Kurds, and the ongoing strife
in many parts of the world carries a racial imprint so
varied, complex, and inconsistent that neither science nor
social science can codify its characteristics. Therefore,
although we think we know what we mean when we refer
to race, racism, or racial purity, historically these terms
have applied to a variety of groups, people, and events.
Race and race theory rests on attempts to explain what
204perceived differences meant to widely disparate people in
varied times and places.
Since Latin American history was from the start an
encounter between assorted groups who differed by what
we will call race, ethnicity, religion, and culture, two
phenomena occurred quite rapidly. First, each group
ascribed a value to the other, seeing the peculiarities of
these strangers as “barbaric” or “uncivilized” or
“unnatural,” usually within a hierarchy capable of
explaining domination. Secondly, the members of each
group began to intermingle and intermix, by choice or not,
immediately creating a hybrid of themselves. The
intermingling of the races (which were themselves
products of centuries of mixture in Europe and America)
did not, however, mean that race lost its significance as a
determinant of difference. If people of supposedly unlike
races were intermingling and creating more and more
variations on themselves, should not the original reason for
seeing themselves as distinct have faded away? Perhaps so,
but this was not the case; in fact, the opposite occurred.
The more that Americans mixed and recreated themselves
in diverse forms, the more rigidly did they define race, the
more stridently did they debate its significance, and the
more actively did they use it as a tool of domination and
subordination.
The nineteenth century was a formative era in the
development of new theories of race, most of which were
extensions and variations on pre-existing notions and thus
carried with them the prejudices and values used to explain
difference since the beginning of time. The liberal patriots
who promoted independence envisioned citizenship in the
205hands of the men of property and standing: educated,
freeborn, and white. Although the wealth and education of
some men (but never women) of color qualified them for
inclusion in the upper echelon of society, commonly the
new leaders were of European heritage, with little or no
non-white ancestry. Interestingly, in his early writings
Simón Bolívar considered the diversity of Latin Americans
as an asset, remarking that they could take pride in their
mixed racial origins. That his great-grandmother was said
to have been part black may have affected the optimism of
his early writings. However, as he became more
discouraged in the face of fragmentation and dissent
among the newly independent lands, the Liberator instead
argued that their “impure” origins weighted down the
people and marred their future prospects. He called for rule
by strong authoritative governments until such time as the
descendants of indigenous, African, and mixed-race people
were uplifted, educated, or otherwise “prepared” to accept
citizenship.
The new ruling elite took for granted their privileged
status, championing individualism and the benefits of
unfettered free trade, separation of Church and state, an
end to the traditional protection of Indian lands, and the
abolition of slavery. Even in Brazil and Cuba, where
slavery would not end until late in the century,
abolitionists invoked liberal principles. For indigenous
communities, however, the effect of free-market
individualism was to deprive Indians of their claims to the
land. Liberals heralded individual self-sufficiency,
democracy, secularism, and the progressive free market as
the road to prosperity and a modern economy, and claimed
that Indian communal lands were an impediment to the
206forward march of progress. Many even considered Indians,
as a people, to be an obstacle to the development of a
modern state. Under the banner of liberalism, thousands of
Indians were turned off their land and forced to fend for
themselves in a world that made no attempt to understand
their languages, disdained their culture, and offered only
the most menial employment. In the name of progress,
landowners laid claim to Indian lands – sometimes legally,
often not. Independence was in most ways a disaster for
the indigenous people of Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador,
Peru, and Bolivia, where they were most heavily
concentrated.
Victimized by liberal economic policy, Indians were
penalized as well by liberal philosophy. Observers and
theorists of the time embraced various brands of
“scientific” racism that divided the world between greater/
whiter and lesser/darker races, attributing apparent human
differences to “biological” or “natural” inadequacy. Spread
from Europe to the elite of much of the world through
societies and publications, eugenicists diverted blame for
the unequal conditions in the world away from the policies
of colonialism and domination attached to the white
nations and people of Europe, and toward biology – a
supposedly immutable “fact of life” about which little
could be done. Accordingly, they contended, Europeans
and their descendants in Latin America were winners in
the natural selection process while Indians, Africans, and
their descendants were losers. Eugenicists in many
countries, including the United States as well as Latin
America, embraced a variety of policies including
sterilization of people of color, the mentally disabled, and
others considered unfit; stratified educational systems
207based on racial criteria; and forced destruction of Indian
communities and deportation of laborers to distant estates.
The thinking of these various Social Darwinists and
eugenicists was divided. Some argued that all non-elite
men of any race, and all women, could be trained and
uplifted so as to qualify for citizenship, while others felt
that the poor and those deemed racially, culturally, or
physically unfit would never advance, and simply had to
be managed or even eliminated.
In the end, the racist premises that triumphed after
independence and were integral to liberal individualism
eliminated the little protection Indians had managed to
hold onto for the first 350 years after the arrival of
Europeans. The Indian population declined in the
post-independence era, while European and mixed-race
populations increased, both through waves of immigrants
arriving in every country (especially Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay, and Chile) and as a result of continued race
mixture. As the Indian and black population decreased in
proportion to whites, the urgency of improving the
conditions of former slaves, Indians, and castas declined,
and was, for the time, all but abandoned in governing
circles.
Gender and Liberalism
If only propertied men were deemed qualified for
citizenship, then liberalism served to exclude women for
many of the same reasons that it excluded the majority of
men. Women lacked autonomy and were, like poor men,
tied to the land, in debt, enslaved, or in some way not free.
Deirdre Keenan, in speaking of the generations of
208architects of racial theory, remarks: “Whether they located
racial difference in the body or in the body politic, or
whether they accounted for racial difference by divine
appointment or natural selection, all of these theories were
created, codified, and institutionalized by men.”6 Hence, it
is impossible to demarcate racial boundaries apart from
gender, since both rest on an explication of the patriarchal
order that was such an important feature of caudillismo
and survived, in a sometimes altered form, under
liberalism.
During and after the wars of independence patriarchy was
contested in many societies. In post-independence
Venezuela, civil laws governing marriage – especially as
they intersected and coincided with Catholic Church
doctrine – relied on a particular ideal of femininity that
was restricted to wife, mother, housekeeper, and called for
general confinement to the domestic sphere. This
remarkably stable construct in Venezuelan society, which
lasted from independence to the early twentieth century,
influenced the freedom accorded female citizens in the
context of the economic and political transformation that
marked the post-independence period. Whereas the
Venezuelan Constitution was the first in Latin America to
espouse liberal ideals of liberty, equality, individual rights,
and citizenship, these rights, as was the case everywhere in
the world at that time, were limited to propertied, mostly
white, men. In Venezuela, as elsewhere, “the issue of
women’s rights was not part of the political discussions,
nor did the Constitution grant women any specific rights.”7
The new liberal doctrine ensured that women, the poor,
and most people of color were excluded from
209nineteenth-century republicanism; however, their
exclusion was played out on a field of defined masculine
values that asserted male dominance and excluded female
participation. Several studies of the general contours of
gender relations in Latin America have concluded that
women actually lost rights when the new states adopted
liberal reforms. Elizabeth Dore refers to “counter-reforms”
to describe what happened to women, as land was
privatized and colonial law secularized in the wake of
independence. As the newly formed nations sought to
adopt the European model of private property and
individual rights, laws promoting the break-up of
communal landholdings and large estates, as occurred in
Mexico under its mid-nineteenth-century “Reforma,”
adversely affected women. In her study of debt peonage in
nineteenth- and twentieth-century Nicaragua, Dore
differentiates these forms of patriarchy as falling into two
categories. She argues that “patriarchy from above” is the
rule of the state through masculine authority, while
“patriarchy from below” is the rule of the father over his
family. Both, she shows, were detrimental to all forms of
economic and political progress.8
In Argentina, despite the
verbal proclamations of rights and liberties, liberals used
“scientific” theories to prove female inferiority. Women
and girls were seen as weak of body and mind, prone to
emotionalism and hysteria, and incapable of deciding for
themselves and meeting the challenges of an aggressively
individualist society.
The buzzword of the era was “private property,” under
which guise many mediumscale landholders were able to
increase the size of their estates, or to lay hold of Indian
communal lands. The large estates attracted the bulk of the
210labor force, drawing workers away from smaller, less
profitable properties. The state sought to ensure an ample
supply of cheap labor for the landowners and other elites
by enacting several laws that diluted parental control over
children, lowered the age of majority, and relaxed
restrictions on child labor. Another free market reform was
the institution of mandatory, partible inheritance, or
inheritance divided among heirs. In most countries
previous laws had required property transmission to favor
the eldest son, or sometimes the eldest daughter if there
were no male heirs, in a primogeniture system. Women
were able to inherit a small sum in this way, but their
ability to manage and invest the money, buy and sell
property, and so forth was so restricted that very few
women could hope to turn a modest inheritance into real
wealth. Pressure on women to marry for reasons of
economic security remained extreme, and their potential
for earning a living outside of marriage became even more
remote. The only professional job available to women in
the nineteenth century was teaching, which became an
important female occupation when localities determined
that they could pay unmarried women less than men. The
market economy thus provided some jobs and
opportunities for women, but most females remained under
the strict control of their husbands or other male relatives.
The new secular republics sought to break the Church’s
hold over all determinations pertaining to marriage,
annulment, sexuality, and legitimacy of birth. Rather than
a shift that would have allowed women to control their
own lives, the state appropriated the Church’s power over
women for itself, and in turn handed that authority over to
fathers and husbands. Under the banner of liberalism,
211patriarchy was reinforced. For example, before
independence the Catholic Church had exclusive power
over enforcing the sanctity of marriage and determining
the legitimacy of heirs (even if the Church chose to ignore
the many illegitimate offspring belonging to men of high
standing). When marriage laws were secularized after
independence, women did not necessarily gain greater
freedom. They were still controlled by husbands who
might now abandon them even more easily, since marriage
was no longer, in the eyes of the state, an enforceable
moral obligation; rather it was simply a legal contract. In
addition, the Church always prohibited adultery by
husbands or wives, since it was a sin against the sanctity of
marriage, regardless of which partner was at fault.
However, post-independence civil laws decreed that
adultery was not illegal for men, but was a capital offense
for women. In Mexico, Argentina, and Nicaragua a
husband’s infidelity was neither criminalized nor
considered grounds for divorce unless he created a public
scandal, or dishonored the daughter of a powerful family.
By contrast, if a husband discovered that his wife was
unfaithful, and he killed her, he could usually escape
prosecution. Court cases in Brazil in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries reveal that men were seldom
prosecuted for killing their wives and their wives’ lovers
when found in adulterous affairs. Thus the authority of the
state and new liberal laws in some cases reinforced
patriarchy.
There were a few bright spots for women, however. Single
and widowed women were allowed authority over, and
responsibility for, their children. This right was not
extended to married women, since to do so would have
212impinged on the authority of husbands. Nonetheless, it was
the first time in modern Latin American history that
women were allowed control over another freeborn person.
New laws also provided for female equality in primary
education, prohibited violence against women and
children, and laid the foundations for greater equality
before the law in some civil cases. As many studies of
nineteenth-century liberalism suggest, the record of
equality for men and women was contradictory. Court
records pertaining to women’s claims of wrongful
treatment at the hands of abusive, adulterous, cheating, and
extortionist husbands, partners and even parents indicate
that women were empowered to object. They occasionally
protested in court and attempted to extend the rights
reserved for men to themselves, demonstrating, even as
their cases failed, that they were far from passive observers
of the liberal order that excluded them.
Intersections of Gender, Race, and Class
In some cases, during the independence wars, women who
were left behind to manage estates, mines, or small plots of
land became decision makers and exerted more authority;
however, the shortage of men in the post-independence era
was not to women’s advantage. When men left to find
work on distant estates and mines after losing their source
of livelihood, marriage choices and marital arrangements
became more complicated for the single women left
behind since there were fewer choices of partners, at least
among their own age group. Also, in areas undergoing a
transition from one nationality or seat of power to another,
as happened after the wars of independence, negotiating
marriages became more problematic. For example, in the
213midnineteenth century, in the northern provinces of
Mexico that moved from Spanish to Mexican to United
States ownership, civil and ecclesiastical laws came into
conflict as elite families sought to arrange marriages using
racial and economic criteria alone, in contrast to the
Church that sought to enforce adherence to religious
principles.
Arranged marriages of very young girls to much older men
demonstrate the marriage mandate for both men and
women that persevered among property-holding members
of nineteenth-century society. Except for those entering
religious orders, marriage was expected of women from
the middle and upper classes – most decidedly because of
the property consolidation that the marriage bond ensured.
Only rarely would a member of an elite family remain
single. For men, marriage choice was not a great
inconvenience – even if they were less than enamored with
the spouse chosen for them – since marriage, while
expected, did not mandate fidelity to one’s wife. Social
convention allowed men to take a mistress, have a
concubine, or engage in short-term dalliances. For
example, it was not unusual for a planter in Brazil, Cuba,
or any rural area to establish his concubine near, or even
in, the family home. His illegitimate children were
accorded a favored place among the retinue of slaves or
peasants on a plantation and, if necessary, he would expect
his legal wife to take care of his children by other women.
Finally, men were even free to show their preference for a
mistress over a wife, although the Church and “polite
society” frowned on such behavior.
214One of the main restrictions on a woman’s marriage choice
was the dowry. Her ability to contract a favorable marriage
depended on her family’s ability to offer a substantial
dowry. For his part, the groom promised to meet the
financial obligations of supporting his wife and family for
the rest of their lives. In the late nineteenth century the
process of giving dowries underwent considerable change
among the elite. Dowries were smaller, less of a proportion
of the parents’ estate, and by the end of the nineteenth
century began to disappear. Not only was the marriage of a
daughter or a son no longer such a substantial investment
for the wealthy family as in earlier times, but, if a dowry
were offered, it increasingly consisted of consumer goods
rather than property or productive assets. Dowries were
never a major concern for poor girls, just as marriage in
the Church or a recognized civil institution was less
common among poor, working-class whites, or among free
and slave people of color, than among the white elite. The
main reason was that both Church and state charged
exorbitant fees for civil and ecclesiastical licenses and
ceremonies. Thus many people entered into common-law
marriages, which is still true in many parts of Latin
America today.
According to Göran Therborn, the major Swedish
sociologist of family structure throughout the world, the
family in twentieth-century Latin America is distinguished
by the absence of officially sanctioned and sanctified
marriages. He calculates that during the nineteenth
century, one-third to one-half of the population of
northeast Brazil never married, instead living in conjugal
union. In the Rio de la Plata region of Argentina,
out-of-wedlock births were four or five times as common
215as in Spain or Italy. In Mexico in 1900 as many as four out
of five sexual unions, stable or otherwise, were maintained
outside any formal marriage ceremony. Therborn attributes
this astounding contrast with the rest of the world to the
high cost of marriage in Latin America, especially the
weighty fees extracted by the Church.9
Throughout Latin America marriage placed limitations on
a woman’s status and power, particularly when gender
intersected with class, as it did for the most elite women
whose participation in the public arena was carefully
circumscribed. But those who managed farms and small
businesses with their husbands enjoyed considerable
equality with men. In Mexico women sold pulque (a
common alcoholic beverage consumed by the poor and
working class), maintained stands in the marketplace,
tended gardens and sold their produce. Among non-elites,
women became heads of household when men died or
deserted the family, often assuming the full management
of businesses, farms, and even mines. A number even
prospered; however, those women who found themselves
alone and with limited resources faced grim prospects,
including prostitution.
According to many scholars, it was during the
mid-nineteenth century that the concept of male honor
became associated with service to nation and work, as
opposed to the narrow world of family, clan, and
community. For women, denied citizenship and lacking
legal rights outside the home, the concept of service to
nation remained defined as service and obedience to men –
father, husband, brother, cleric, and grown son. However,
as civil society restrained the hold of the Church over
216education, charity, and public welfare, women stepped in
to provide crucial service functions, including formal
education of the young, and their introduction to social
norms and values. Upper-class women, in particular,
engaged in fund-raising to support new statesponsored and
private hospitals, orphanages, workhouses, homes for
“wayward” women, and a host of other educational and
charitable institutions. Women increasingly inserted
themselves into the broader spectrum of society’s
concerns, both to perform a needed service and for the
example they set as virtuous representatives of republican
morality.
In conclusion, a hierarchical economic and social order
influenced – and sometimes dictated – the way people
lived, interacted with each other, and made choices about
their own future and that of their children. Gender, race,
class, and social position came together to provide the field
upon which economic and political interactions and
transactions were played. Nonetheless, the social norms
and expectations varied among individuals, within regions,
and over time. This variation left much of Latin American
society twisting within a paradox. Societies sought to
demarcate family lines, property holdings, racial lineage,
and community ties through a complex set of rulings that
restricted the social movement of individuals and families.
Yet the freedom that patriarchy granted to men to produce
illegitimate children increasingly blurred racial categories
and dictated the passage of laws that placed the growing
number of mixed-race women at the mercy of white,
powerful, men. So long as the power of the wealthy and
landowners remained uncontested, the patriarchal order
held firm. It was reinforced in myriad institutions of elite
217power, including kinship, godparenthood, nepotism, and
clientelism, along with dowries and arranged marriages. At
the same time Latin America in the mid-nineteenth century
was the heyday of the caudillo a man who epitomized
patriarchal authority in an all-embracing expression of
economic and political power.
Nationalism
Little about caudillismo conjures up a world of high art
and culture; indeed, from Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s
perspective, it plummeted society to the depths of
barbarism. However, counterbalancing forces in the newly
independent worlds of art, music, and literature were
emerging. With independence, Latin America embarked
on a new aesthetic, replacing the stultifying scholasticism
of the colonial period (a dogmatic belief in the Church’s
revealed “truth”) with romanticism in the early decades of
the nineteenth century, and with realism later in the
century. Romanticism, epitomized in Sarmiento’s classic
story Facundo, Civilization and Barbarism, appeared as
the counterweight to the reality of disorganized federalism
dominated by caudillos. Art and literature drew on human
emotions, more understandable in the midst of a political
world that lacked stable models, while architecture
expressed the independent nations’ fascination with
European neoclassical grandeur. In imperial Brazil the
capital city of Rio de Janeiro sported new libraries,
theaters, and operas in the image of Europe, while Buenos
Aires had emerged as the most European of Latin
American cities by century’s end. Art, music, and
architecture of the time suggested a set of nations
218searching for independent identity, while at the same time
clinging to established forms of European civilization.
The nineteenth century swayed back and forth between
romanticizing indigenous peoples and the bedrock
peasantry for its oneness with American soil, to trading the
integrity of America for European neoclassicism inherited
from the colonial period. By century’s end, realism had
increasingly replaced romanticism, most apparent in the
writings of Cuba’s José Martí (1853–95) and Brazilian
journalist Euclides da Cunha (1866–1909). Both spoke out
against the legacy of dogged emulation of European and
North American concepts of civilization, while searching
for a genuine Latin American identity. For Martí, Latin
America’s future depended on the cultural unity the
nations of “our America” would forge with each other
(Figure 4.2). Elaborating on a theme that Bolívar had
raised early in the century, Martí strove not so much for
political unity in a single federation, but for cultural unity
and political and economic cooperation as a bulwark
against the expansionism of North America. In his many
writings from the United States, where he lived in exile for
decades, Martí repeated the theme that Latin America’s
sovereignty rested with its ability to find its soul, define its
identity, and forge its own unique community (see Box
4.2). He was killed at the age of 42 as he participated in the
first battle for Cuban independence in 1895. He never saw
the island liberated from Spain, nor, mercifully, did he
witness its de facto colonization and subsequent
humiliation at the hands of the United States at century’s
end.
Conclusion
219Latin America at the end of the nineteenth century was
virtually independent, enjoyed trade and political relations
with the world at large, and, in spite of cultural
fragmentation and geographic separation, was forging a
new national identity.Nevertheless, many of the same
inequalities persisted that had separated people by race,
class, gender, religion, culture, language, and geography at
the start of the century. On the isolated highlands and vast
rural plains, peasants exchanged landlords formerly
subservient to Spain and Portugal for others that wielded
authority as local strongmen, looking toward England and
the US for economic and, often, military support. The
privileges of citizenship remained off-limits to many,
probably most, of the continent’s residents, while the
Creole elite held firm to the reins of political and economic
power. Women had little authority because they lacked the
right to participate as independent actors in society –
although wealthy women enjoyed the comforts and
amenities of their class despite the limitations imposed by
husbands, fathers, and male authority in general.

220221Box 4.2 José Martí and the American identity
The essay “Our America” by José Martí has long
been considered one of the most important
declarations of the need for Latin America to take
pride in its heritage and assume its place on equal
terms with the United States and Europe. The
following passage excerpts some of the essay’s key
concepts:
In what lands can men take more pride that in our
long-suffering American republics, raised up
among the silent Indian masses by the bleeding
arms of a hundred apostles, to the sound of battle
between the book and processional candle? Never
in history have such advanced and united nations
been forged in so short a time from such
disorganized elements...
And the able governor in America is not the one
who knows how to govern the Germans or the
French; he must know the elements that make up
his own country, and how to bring them together,
using methods and institutions originating within
the country, to reach that desirable state where each
man can attain selfrealization and all may enjoy the
abundance that Nature has bestowed in everyone in
the nation to enrich with their toil and defend with
their lives. Government must originate in the
country. The spirit of government must be that of
222the country. Its structure must conform to rules
appropriate to the country. Good government is
nothing more than the balance of the country’s
natural elements...
How can the universities produce governors if not
a single university in America teaches the
rudiments of the art of government, the analysis of
elements peculiar to the peoples of America? The
young go out into the world wearing Yankee or
French spectacles, hoping to govern a people they
do not know. In the political race entrance should
not go for the best ode, but for the best study of the
political factors of one’s country...
To know one’s country and govern it with that
knowledge is the only way to free it from tyranny.
The European university must bow to the
American university. The history of America, from
the Incas to the present, must be taught in clear
detail and to the letter, even if the archons of
Greece are overlooked. Our Greece must take
priority over the Greece which is not ours. We
need it more. Nationalist statement must replace
foreign statement. Let the world be grafted onto
our republics, but the trunk must be our own. And
let the vanquished pedant hold his tongue, for there
are no lands in which a man may take greater pride
than in our long-suffering American republics...
223There can be no racial animosity, because there are
no races.... The soul, equal and eternal, emanates
from bodies of different shapes and colors.
Whoever foments and spreads antagonism and hate
between the races, sins against humanity.
From José Martí, “Our America,” La Revista
Ilustrada, New York, January 1, 1891.
If the Creole patriots who emerged victorious at the end of
the independence wars did not see themselves as
particularly concerned with the plight of the humble,
neither were they all complacent about the poverty all
around them. The men in charge in post-colonial Latin
America were a varied lot. Indeed some were tyrants, just
as Sarmiento described them; others were not, but still
accepted the “scientific” theories of the era that discounted
the possibility for advancement of society’s poorest and
most marginalized, as well as their own wives, sisters, and
daughters. They trusted liberalism, championed
individualism, and some even presumed that the
communal-minded Indian would one day flourish as an
independent farmer. While the best of the Creole elite were
anxious to build prosperous independent nations, the strife
of future centuries would demonstrate the shortcomings
inherent in their liberal doctrine.

Latin America’s Place in the Commodity Chain
“The deed is done, the nail is driven, Spanish America is
free, and if we do not mismanage our affairs sadly, she is
English,” declared George Canning (1770–1827) in 1824.
The British Foreign Secretary from 1822 to 1827 was not
expressing a desire on England’s part to recolonize the
newly independent states. Rather he was speculating on the
potential for foreign trade, markets for British goods, and
access to Latin America’s extensive natural resources in
minerals and agricultural products, which he envisioned
flowing on English ships to English seaports to be
processed in English factories and resold throughout the
British Empire.1
Indebted to England for the cost of
waging the independence wars, weakened by long years of
political upheaval, and facing chaotic conditions at home
that interfered with the orderly establishment of internal
affairs, the new states of Latin America welcomed the
opportunity to sell to Britain. Although by the twentieth
century a sector of the ruling elite was chafing at the
domination Britain and other foreign powers exerted over
Latin American economies, during the first years after
independence – and in some countries for a long time
thereafter – Latin America embraced free trade policies.
Domestic latifundistas and merchant capitalists sold raw
materials and some manufactured goods abroad, in return
for investment in the infrastructure and industrial base that
would promote development at home.
225Because the greatest wealth was to be gained from
exporting cash crops, as opposed to growing and
consuming diversified agricultural products that would
lead to selfsufficiency, the estates focused on one or two
crops, a system known as monoculture. Latin America was
well situated to feed the growing European population: its
exports ranged from Brazilian coffee to fruit and other
agricultural products from Central America, sugar from the
Caribbean islands, and meat, hides, wheat and other grains
from Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. The region
also exported minerals and ores from Mexico, Chile,
Bolivia, and other areas, guano from Peru, and ultimately
oil from Venezuela and Mexico. New forms of economic
control, known as neocolonialism, replaced the old
constraints imposed by colonialism. In addition, the export
economy created a demand for roads, port facilities,
transportation and communication networks, all of which
required large capital outlays. Rather than investing
revenues from exports into the generation and expansion
of a dynamic infrastructure, many countries relied on the
resources and technology that could be supplied by
England, and subsequently the United States. This
combination of monoculture and an export-led economy
pulled Latin America away from self-sufficiency and
internal stability toward an economic model based on
capital infusion from the outside and dependence on
fluctuating international demand. Finally, economic
historians have argued that commodity exports need to be
considered as a “two-way bridge,” with production at one
end and consumption at the other. As such, goods from
Latin America entered into a broad, international
commodity chain, producing goods for consumption
abroad, the demand for which could fluctuate widely.
226This chapter seeks to explain both the benefits and the
pitfalls deriving from the pursuit of economic liberalism,
which fostered individual over state ownership, using
several country and commodity examples: Peru and the
guano boom of the nineteenth century, when a single,
tremendously lucrative export tipped the balance toward
domestic self-sufficiency for a time, but ultimately
discouraged diversification and domestic enterprise; Brazil
and a series of boom-and-bust cycles that elevated one
regional economy, only to have the boom go bust and
prosperity move to another region (with the exception of
São Paulo, which remained prosperous). The mining of
nitrates in Chile and coffee cultivation in Colombia
provide examples of commodities that have maintained
modest levels of prosperity although not without outside
and domestic government assistance. In Mexico we look at
a different phenomenon, wherein a nascent hide and tallow
trade in the cash-poor distant northern territories led to the
landowners’ reliance on the expanding US market. Among
the smaller Central American and Caribbean nations,
autonomous economic development never got off the
ground. Small nations found themselves overrun by the
powerful sugar, fruit, railroad, shipping, and mineral
monopolies of the North American trusts in an era
characterized by “robber barons.”
The Guano Boom
The harvest and export of guano (bird dung used for
fertilizer) from islands off the southern coast of Peru offers
a story of intense regional economic prosperity, followed
by sudden decline. Whereas coffee cultivation in Brazil,
sugar in Cuba, and a host of other examples demonstrate
227the effects of persistent reliance on a single (or very few)
export crops, harvesting guano exemplifies the economic
and social impact of a spike in demand followed by
precipitous decline.
Over centuries bird droppings had accumulated in layers
hundreds of feet thick on the Chincha Islands off the coast
of Peru, producing a substance that proved to be a highly
rich plant fertilizer. In the mid-nineteenth century Europe
entered a heightened agricultural boom, offering an ideal
market for processed guano fertilizer, resulting in the
transformation of a small local trade into a fabulously
lucrative international export commodity for Peru. From
1841 to 1879 guano was Peru’s most important export;
revenues were in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
providing a healthy infusion of capital into the depressed,
post-independence economy. Since guano fertilizer was
known for boosting the productivity of a range of crops,
including turnips, tobacco, grains, and vegetables, and
since it was relatively inexpensive, European demand at
first appeared to be boundless. Peruvian guano was
instrumental to Europe’s nineteenthcentury agricultural
revolution and ensuing population increase. As quickly as
it began, however, the trade declined when Chilean nitrates
and other forms of fertilizer replaced guano, especially as
the latter became increasingly scarce and harder to collect
and transport. By the mid-1870s the much-celebrated “Age
of Guano” was ending, leaving in its wake a devastated
economy. In 1876 Peru defaulted on its foreign debt and
the region entered a crisis from which it would not soon
emerge.
228Although the guano trade was highly lucrative, assets were
very unevenly distributed throughout Peruvian society;
most revenues accrued to the government and in turn to a
small group of capitalists engaged in the trade. The
Peruvian government controlled the guano fields, granting
to a few individual companies the rights to handle sales.
The private merchants were not required to – and did not –
return their profits as investment into the local economy.
Neither did the Peruvian state ensure that guano revenues
poured into the betterment of the nation as a whole.
Consistent with liberal economic policies popular at the
time, Peru had drawn heavily on loans from British
financiers to build the infrastructure, transportation,
communication and other service networks needed to
advance the trade, offer credit to new businesses, and
increase government programs – but not to raise the
educational level and standard of living of the populace.
From the 1840s to the late 1870s both the state and
privatesector bureaucracies expanded rapidly, including
government offices, financial markets, commercial and
real estate networks.
By the 1860s, when guano sales climaxed and before the
slide downward, guano alone had brought in over $500
million in export earnings from the sale abroad.
Nonetheless, not every part of the economy profited
equally and some parts suffered, rather than benefited,
from the guano boom. Small agricultural producers,
artisans, and domestic manufacturers, unable to compete
with the cheaper and higher-quality imported goods that
began to flood the market, went out of business. The
sectors that grew tremendously were linked directly or
229indirectly to foreign trade and positioned to benefit from
British financial generosity.
When guano went bust in the 1860s, Peru’s government
and a small coterie of private entrepreneurs found
themselves heavily in debt and no longer able to meet
debtservicing payments. As the country entered a crisis,
the social strife that resulted from Peru’s failure to address
social inequalities and hardships left over from the colonial
and independence war eras, compounded by the unequal
distribution of benefits from the guano boom, came back
to haunt the country in full force. The government had not
used the increased revenues to raise living standards, train
a core of local technicians, entrepreneurs, and domestic
intelligentsia capable of advancing a diversified economy.
In the midst of social upheaval, strikes, and demonstrations
the Peruvian government desperately looked for a way to
build national unity and gain a share in extracting nitrates,
the next major fertilizer business. Peru, in alliance with
Bolivia, went to war against Chile in 1879 over control of
a disputed area of the Atacama Desert. Peru’s loss pushed
it further into debt, while Chile used its victory in this
conflict, known by the grandiose name “War of the
Pacific” (1879–83), to take from Bolivia the tiny strip of
land through which the latter had access to the sea. The
Chilean government sold off the nitrate processing
business to private, mainly foreign, companies and kept for
itself the revenue from the export tax on sales. With a hold
on the largest nitrate deposits in the world, Chile’s tax
revenue alone was so high as to provide nearly half of the
government’s total income in the last years of the century.
Nitrates in Chile
230The exploitation of nitrates from the Atacama Desert
picked up as guano supplies dwindled, and some foreign
investors transferred their operations from Peru to Chile.
Like guano, nitrates were primarily destined for use in
fertilizers for the North Atlantic market, but also for the
United States, especially plantations in the South. Nitrates
could also be used in explosives, and thus commanded a
broader, more flexible, market share. The Chilean
government’s decision to lease nitrate exploitation to
foreign firms has been criticized for following the same
path as Peru just decades earlier. There is some truth to
this charge, but recent studies of nineteenth-century
commodity chains point out that Chile may well have
benefited as best it could from the arrangement, given its
limited means of reaching foreign markets on its own.
Another, perhaps more valid, criticism focuses on the way
that the Peruvian and Chilean governments invested the
profits from these boom economies. The influx of revenue
was, for a few decades in Peru and many more in Chile, an
opportunity to build infrastructure, promote public
education, and generally benefit their respective societies,
building an autonomous and prosperous citizenry. This
opportunity was largely ignored; neither the government
nor the few elites benefiting from the export booms saw fit
to spread the wealth in the interest of national
development.
From outside the country, European and US entrepreneurs,
many of them modern-day “conquistadores,” roamed the
southern hemisphere looking for lucrative returns on quick
investments. Henry Meiggs (1821–77) was a colorful
entrepreneur who personified the imperialist and
expeditionary views of the nineteenth century. Born in
231Boston, Meiggs moved to Chile in 1854 after a stint in
California, where he reputedly made and lost millions of
dollars in several schemes. Undaunted by past failures,
Meiggs set about raising funds to build a railroad in Chile.
He succeeded in constructing a line from Santiago to the
south and another one from Santiago to the port of
Valparaiso. With the fortune he amassed in the railroad
business, he built an elaborate mansion in Chile. Soon
restless, he left Chile in the 1860s and moved to Peru,
where he invested in the guano trade, and then used his
profits to build a railroad from Lima to the Altiplano at a
height of 14,000 feet. One might argue that Meiggs’s
railroads benefited the economies of both Chile and Peru,
and so they did in the short term. On the other hand,
Meiggs’s investments promoted the development of
infrastructure to service the export economy rather than
domestic development. Secondly, although Meiggs was
known for paying local workers at rates above domestic
entrepreneurs, his enormous profits largely left the
country. So long as neither the Peruvian nor Chilean
governments had the political clout to recoup revenues,
through income and corporate taxes, to support internal
development, the system of “robber barons” so well known
in the US in this period functioned yet more freely in
South America.
Sugar and Coffee
Brazil’s boom-and-bust export cycles were both similar to
and different from those in Peru and Chile. First, Brazil
was so large that one or another part of the country could
be prospering while another was undergoing decline (see
Map 5.1). Thus Brazil can be seen as moving through a
232series of boom/bust cycles, a phenomenon that stretched
back to activities of the first Portuguese settlers who
exported brazil wood in the 1500s, a lucrative trade that
gave the country its name. When permanent settlements
appeared along the northeastern coast, they relied on sugar
cultivation on plantations worked by slaves from Africa to
generate wealth. By 1650 Brazil’s northeast was the
world’s largest sugar producer, exporting 2.5 million
pounds a year, making it one of the richest single regions
of the Americas. The lucrative sugar trade attracted the
attention of other European powers, especially the Dutch
who occupied the northeast and profited from the sugar
trade from 1630 to 1654. When the Portuguese reclaimed
the territory, sugar exports were facing competition from
several sources, including English colonies in Jamaica and
Barbados and the French colony at Saint-Domingue. By
the 1780s Caribbean plantations were out-producing those
in Brazil, where mills stood in disrepair and the soil at
many plantations was nearing exhaustion. Between 1650
and 1715 Brazil’s income from sugar declined by
two-thirds. One of the richest areas of agricultural
production on the entire planet in the early seventeenth
century had gone bankrupt in less than one hundred years.
The northeast experienced a brief recovery in the 1790s,
immediately after the Haitian Revolution, only to be
outdone by Cuban sugar producers, who profited from that
country’s richer soil and more efficient mills in the
nineteenth century.

Europe. (Based on E. Bradford Burns, A History of Brazil,
2nd edition, ca. 1980. By permission Columbia University
Press.)
233The reasons for the precipitous decline in Brazil were
several. Initially the big planters, or senhores de engenho,
saw little reason to make the sugar mills and plantations
more efficient, relying as they could on a steady supply of
slaves for most of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries. As it became clear that Brazil’s share of the
international sugar market was declining rapidly, many
planters, especially in the state of Pernambuco, attempted
to modernize, employing paid laborers alongside slaves,
renting out land to sharecroppers from whom they could
draw some income rather than letting it lie fallow, and
234experimenting with steam power and better technology in
the mills. Nonetheless, their efforts came too late and
proved to be inadequate.
Second, the heavy reliance on a single commodity for a
limited market abroad brought the sugar planters to the
same fate as Peru’s guano merchants. Demand for Brazil’s
sugar fell when Europeans began importing sugar from
their own island possessions on a large scale, but a boom
in beet sugar cultivation in Europe diminished demand for
the more expensive cane sugar products, reducing further
the narrow profit margin for Brazilian planters. Finally,
and again similar to what happened with guano and, later,
nitrates in the Andean nations, the sugar boom had not
introduced a diversified, self-sustaining economy that
could prosper after sugar’s decline. Foreign capital was
used to finance roads, rail, and communication lines
constructed to connect sugar plantations with the point of
embarkation for exports, not to lay the foundation for a
regional transportation network servicing domestic trade.
Moreover, as in Peru, planters used their profits to
purchase consumer goods from Europe (textiles, furniture,
and fine crafts), thereby limiting demand for goods
produced by domestic manufacturing and artisanal
enterprises.
The Growth of São Paulo
Latin America turned much of the world into coffee
drinkers, providing inexpensive-grade coffee for mass
consumption, combined with finer-grade Costa Rican,
Colombian, Guatemalan and other varieties for more
specialized markets. By the mid-twentieth century, Brazil
235would supply 80 percent of the world’s coffee. The story
of Brazil’s preeminence as a coffee producer and exporter
largely unfolded after independence from Portugal in
1822; by the 1840s coffee was by far the leading export
commodity. Today coffee cultivation bears some of the
characteristics of the old plantation system, but also shows
signs of modern agricultural methods. First introduced in
1727 into the far northern state of Pará with some seeds
from French Guiana, coffee reached Rio de Janeiro by
1770 and flourished in the Paraiba Valley before moving
west when the soil of the coastal hills became depleted. By
the mid-nineteenth century the coffee tree found its home
in the states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and as far south as
Paraná.
The effect of coffee cultivation on the nation’s economy,
especially in shifting the vital center from the northeast to
the southeast, played a tremendously important role in
Brazil’s history. Coffee production attracted foreign capital
and generated domestic profits that were poured into
manufacturing and commercial ventures in São Paulo. It
facilitated the introduction of new technologies,
encouraged railroad construction, and opened up new areas
of Brazil, to the west and south of São Paulo state. Some
operators managed enormous estates worked by many
slaves, while others relied on a few slaves or a
combination of wage and slave labor to cultivate a modest
amount of land. In general, planters experimented with
crop rotation, fertilizers, and innovative agronomy
methods to increase production, as well as investing in
new technology rather than simply relying on longer
working hours for their slaves and free laborers. Coffee
introduced far-reaching political, economic, and social
236changes in Brazil, including the construction of rail lines
from the fields to the port in Santos; industrial
development, especially in the state of São Paulo; and an
influx of immigrants. Following emancipation in 1888,
coffee planters began to use immigrant labor on a larger
scale, even subsidizing the cost of transporting them from
Italy, and later Japan. The important role played by
government-sponsored immigration in Brazil and
elsewhere in Latin America is a major topic of the next
chapter.
The impact of the coffee economy on Brazil’s southeast
was dramatically different from that of sugar in the
northeast, mainly because coffee revenues stimulated
urban and industrial development, whereas sugar revenues
had not. Yet coffee replicated several of the features
associated with the sugar economy: production on large
plantations; dependence on a single crop; heavy reliance
on slave labor in the years before abolition; and the
flourishing of plantation systems governed by a patriarch
whose influence over family, community, and workforce
was largely unquestioned; as well as reliance on foreign
merchants. Some coffee estates were worked by more than
200 slaves, making them far larger than most northeastern
sugar plantations (Figure 5.1). Since coffee trees have a
life span of 20 years, but take four to six years to mature, a
single plantation has trees growing at various stages of
maturity. The investment in labor, trees, and extensive
acreage means that large-scale production for export is
expensive, although small coffee farms have always
existed alongside larger plantations and Brazil’s coffee
regions have always supported a number of smaller
237operators who produce cheaper coffee for the local market,
along with cassava, manioc, and other staples.

coffee beans, ca. nineteenth century. (Hoffenberg
Collection)
According to historian Bill Albert, in his book South
America and the First World War, at the turn of the
twentieth century foreign merchants, mainly British,
controlled about 60 percent of Brazil’s foreign coffee
sales. Operating through a few dozen tightly controlled
firms, foreign merchants assumed a powerful position
linking rural planters with the world of trade abroad.
Albert explains that British firms’ contacts on the world
market, control of credit, and increasing interest in
238processing and warehousing agricultural products gave
Britain considerable authority over Brazil’s foreign trade.
Brazil’s economic dependence on both the export market
and foreign investors, in turn, strongly influenced the
autonomy of the industrial elite. Relying on foreign
investors allowed Brazil’s own entrepreneurs to avoid
taking risks with their own profits. Likewise the
government did not have to have sufficient credit reserves
to bail out failing investors in the early, and precarious,
stage of capitalist expansion. In short, largescale Brazilian
planters and merchants could get very rich very fast by
tying themselves firmly to the coat-tails of powerful
British trading houses, investors, and middlemen.
This dependence had shifted by the 1920s, when more and
more of the world coffee supply originated from just 10
exporting firms in Brazil that by the mid-twentieth century
were supplying nearly 80 percent of the world’s coffee.
Only then did the Brazilian government assume a central
role in subsidizing coffee profits and ensuring that the
market share of sales remained firmly under the control of
Brazilian entrepreneurs.
Colombian Coffee
The nineteenth century saw the emergence of new regional
economies that were carving out niches for specific
commodities in the expanding export markets. In
Colombia coffee cultivation spread into previously
uncultivated highland regions, producing a particularly
savory type of coffee bean. Coffee exports boomed from
the 1880s onward and would by the 1920s account for 70
percent of Colombian exports. Unlike Brazil, where coffee
239had been cultivated on large plantations since the
beginning of the boom in the nineteenth century, in
Colombia most coffee plantations were small-scale
operations. This had both positive and negative effects. In
the first place, growers on small farms, and some on larger
plantations, became a powerful segment of the
economically and politically active citizenry. It seemed,
for a while at least, that Colombia might develop a large
middle class made up of small producers, which would
tend to generate a more equitable distribution of income.
The problem with the smallholdings, however, was that
cultivation under these conditions made for a very rich,
aromatic coffee, but the product was more expensive to
grow and ship. Since coffee trees mature over five to six
years, and then produce only for a limited amount of time,
plantations that cover large amounts of land can more
efficiently rotate through the trees in various stages of
maturation. The modest plantations in Colombia had a
difficult time competing with the huge estates in Brazil,
Guatemala, and El Salvador. In the latter three cases giant
corporations such as the United Fruit Company, and other
major coffee producers, kept the price of coffee high by
controlling large tracts of land, and holding it untilled in
reserve.
Another positive effect can be seen in the stimulus that
profits from coffee exports lent to Colombia’s broader
economic prosperity. Coffee production in Colombia
contributed to the development of an infrastructure,
especially roads from the coastline to the expanding coffee
groves in more distant areas of the country. Railway
construction, however, was not as successful in Colombia
as it had been in Argentina, where the flat plains facilitated
240the spread of rail transportation from the port to the
interior. In addition to coffee, other agricultural goods
became prime exports, including flowers, fruits, and
bananas, as well as livestock. By the 1920s coffee was
enjoying the status of a fixeddemand commodity, meaning
it was always consumed, even in times of economic
downturn. In addition, the primary market for Colombia’s
coffee was the United States, which was a stable market
compared, for example, to Europe, where imports were
interrupted during World War II. Coffee, as well as
textiles, hides and leather, fruits and flowers, would have
seemed to provide Colombia with the means to develop a
healthy economy free of some of the perils of latifundia
that plagued other countries in the region. Indeed that was
the case until the 1940s, when declines in foreign revenues
combined with particularly virulent political rivalries
between the Liberal and Conservative parties dragged
Colombia into years of political chaos and poor economic
performance.
The Rubber Boom
If coffee serves as an example of steadily expanding sales
on foreign markets, the story of Brazilian rubber exports
illustrates the other end of the spectrum. Rubber provided
an enormous amount of wealth to a relatively small group
in Brazil’s Amazon region beginning in the 1870s, but
then collapsed completely after 1910. Called the “rubber
boom,” this period was actually a “boom gone bust” in the
span of just 50 years. During its heyday, the rubber trade
attracted laborers, speculators, and merchants from all over
the world. It opened a region of Brazil that had been
largely ignored, except by missionaries and naturalists,
241since the earliest exploration of the country. It also paved
the way for the extinction of the remaining Indians, who
had lived far removed from modern society and the
diseases and destruction that befell the vast majority of
indigenous people in the Americas.
Long before the arrival of Europeans, people had been
extracting a milky white fluid called latex from the Hevea
brasiliensis tree that grows wild in the Amazon tropical
rainforest. The exact uses they made of the natural rubber,
which they formed into objects after smoking it over a fire
until it coagulated, is not clear. Early Portuguese explorers
wrote in their journals of this strange substance, which
they eventually used to make crude boots. The boots never
became a large enterprise, since “tapping” the latex from
the tree, a process of scoring the trunk and letting the latex
substance drain out, was highly labor intensive and fairly
slow. This changed in the nineteenth century, however. By
the 1840s British and US scientists had discovered a way
to stabilize raw rubber through a process call
“vulcanization,” and the mini-boom began. Industrializing
countries wanted rubber for bicycle and wagon tires,
insulation, and other industrial uses. Demand skyrocketed,
as did the number of migrants pouring into the Amazon
region in hopes of making a fortune collecting and selling
the latex. Others came to provide food, services,
entertainment, and other amenities in demand in the new
boomtowns. First Belém, at the mouth of the Amazon
River, and then Manaus, a small outpost far upstream,
became main entrepôts for the shipment of huge balls of
rubber from Brazil to the world outside. British steamboats
plied the river trading with local firms that formed the
rubber balls, exporting rubber in exchange for food, tools,
242and supplies. The riverboats connected with ships at the
port of Belém, from which the rubber was shipped abroad.
The rubber boom created instant millionaires or “rubber
barons.” The population of Manaus soared from a
scattering of settlers to nearly 100,000 people in 1910.
Wealthy rubber barons, anxious to demonstrate their grasp
of high culture to the world, built a magnificent opera
house constructed with imported materials (Figure 5.2), in
addition to the first electric street lighting of any city in the
country, piped water and gas, and an elaborate system of
floating docks. In 1912 the Madeira-Mamoré Railway,
further upriver, was completed to connect Brazil and
Bolivia. Despite the grandeur of the opera house and the
riches rubber provided, Brazil’s place as the rubber capital
did not endure. Aware that rubber trees could grow outside
the Amazon region, British scientists managed to hide
some seeds in parcels and bring them to England, where
they reproduced the plants in the British Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew. British traders then transported the
seedlings to plantations in their colonies in Ceylon (Sri
Lanka) and Malaya (Malaysia), thus sparking a lively,
competing trade. South Asian rubber plants, cultivated on
plantations rather than harvested from wild trees, produced
a higher yield, destroying the market for Brazil. By 1910, a
major economic enterprise had folded. During World War
I scientists developed a synthetic substitute and the use of
natural rubber declined dramatically, although a limited
market for natural rubber still exists.

Sacardim was commissioned to design the theater in the
Renaissance style, employing building materials from
Paris and England; marble for stairs, statues, and columns
from Italy; and up-to-date design including electric lights.

Expanding Exports
Other aspects of the boom-bust production cycles
characterized Brazil’s development. Gold, and then
diamonds, were discovered in Minas Gerais in the 1700s.
After initial frenzied speculation, however, gem mining
declined, becoming a stable enterprise but not generating
the vast fortunes originally expected. In the late nineteenth
century cacao trees were planted in various parts of Brazil,
244such as Pará and Rio Negro in the Amazon forest, and
eventually in the northeastern state of Bahia. Immortalized
in the classic tales by Jorge Amado (1912–2001), one of
Brazil’s most popular novelists, the wars among the cacao
barons hold a place in the national psyche analogous to the
shoot-outs in the Old West of the United States. The
promise of great wealth panned out for only a few of the
most powerful planters, although the myth lived on long
after the decline in cacao cultivation and exports. Ecuador,
a longstanding cacao producer, held the preeminent
position past World War I, outstripping Brazil and
Venezuela. In the late twentieth century, cacao was being
produced in other areas of the world, many of them outside
Latin America. Thus, cacao, and the chocolate produced
from it, may be one of Latin America’s great contributions
to world cuisine, but it was not the sole contributor.
Brazil’s boom-bust cycles contributed to a pattern of
unstable growth, and of decentralized and erratic political
power centers, as products boomed in one place, then
declined, and the center shifted to a different locale.
Nevertheless, individuals involved in the trade and subject
to the rise and fall of the demand for rubber were neither
passive participants nor victims. According to Barbara
Weinstein, in her history of the rise and fall of the rubber
boom, rubber tappers did all they could to adapt to the
shifting demand, roamed over large expanses of land,
opened up new areas, and innovated to the extent possible
in the extraction of more latex, while merchants sought to
find new markets. While Brazil lost out to competitors in
the international commodity chain in the sale of rubber, it
maintained its position and ultimately excelled in the
production of coffee.
245Contemporary historians look back to the experience of
nineteenth-century British hegemony, when the small
island exerted unparalleled economic, political and cultural
influence over much of the globe, and draw comparisons
with other empires. Inevitably focus centers on the
subsequent rise of the United States as a similar global
powerhouse in the twentieth century. Both Britain and the
US rose to prominence as industrial giants, a fact that
differs from the Spanish, French, and Portuguese, whose
success as world colonial powers occurred in the
pre-industrial era. There were, however, key differences in
the early stages and in the ultimate outcome of English and
US influence, especially as regards Latin America. For all
its global reach, Britain never sought to annex territory in
the Americas, holding only those colonies in the West
Indies and on the rim of the Caribbean – mainly Guyana,
Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados, Belize – it had taken in the
earlier pre-industrial era. The United States, on the other
hand, played a stronger political role in the hemisphere,
overtaking and eventually annexing a large swath of
Mexican territory and absorbing Cuba, Puerto Rico, and a
slice of the Virgin Islands into its political sphere as formal
or informal colonies.
It is of no small importance to understand the difference
between relationships of trade, even unequal trading
relationships, and imperialism, especially as regards the
direct political and military acquisition of territory. No
matter what role Britain may have played in other parts of
the world, especially in Africa and Asia, it was never a
major imperial power in the Americas in the same way that
the United States eventually was. The narrative of
dominance and dependence, that posits Latin America as
246sequentially overpowered by a series of outsiders – Spain,
Portugal, France, and a few others in the sixteenth through
eighteenth centuries, then Great Britain in the nineteenth,
and lastly the United States in the twentieth – is too
simple. In each specific era the relationship of Latin
American nations with the rest of the world was complexly
intertwined in a maze of political, economic, even cultural
ties. Moreover, at no point through all the centuries could
one say that colonizers, merchants, investors, and military
officers operated without the consent of at least a section
of the domestic ruling elite. Similarly, no country
submitted without a fight, at least for very long, from a
large swath of the population.
Mexico and US Expansionism
If South America was drawn more closely into the web of
English trade and manufacture – and the unstable
development pattern such investment produced – Mexico
fell prey to the expansionist designs of the US. Emerging
from the independence war with Spain broken and
bankrupt, the country’s seat of government in Mexico City
held little control over the extensive territories in the far
north, an area that was inviting settlement by Yankee
explorers, farmers, miners, and the general spillover from
the early nineteenth-century influx of European
immigrants into eastern US cities. Mexico, for its part, had
never encouraged European immigration on a large scale,
and was thus less compelled to push out settlements into
the far reaches of its territory, except for a few
colonization projects in New Mexico and Arizona. The
northern provinces in particular, encompassing northern
California, present-day Colorado, and Texas, were sparsely
247settled and had been explored only by Jesuit and
Franciscan missionaries set on converting the remote
indigenous population to Christianity.
From the outset there was tension over the goals of the
Spanish, and subsequently Mexican, governments and the
Church, especially in the more distant territories. Priests
had argued throughout the colonial period that soldiers and
settlers constituted a corrupting influence on the Indians
they sought to convert, since the settlers were made up of
unruly peoples of mixed race whose presence, according to
clergymen sent directly from Spain, impacted negatively
on the Indians. Nevertheless, colonial authorities
recognized that in order to maintain military and political
control over a huge territory that was coveted by England,
Russia, and the United States, Spain needed towns with
women and the potential for permanent settlements.
In 1777 Spanish settlers established the first town at San
José and the second at Los Angeles, a half-day’s walk
from the existing San Gabriel mission. Others continued
up the coast, followed by settlers and soldiers enticed
northward by the promise of considerable plots of land
upon retirement from service. When the first round of
soldiers retired in 1784, Spanish governor Pedro Fages
doled out land grants, including 43,000 acres to Juan José
Dominguez, a 65-year-old soldier; a 36,000-acre grant to
José Maria Verdugo; and the largest, 75,000 acres, to
Manuel Perez Nieto. Between 1784 and 1821 colonial
authorities issued about 30 land grants to retired soldiers
and a few more to newly arrived settlers from other parts
of New Spain. Indicative of the humble background of
these suddenly land-rich grantees, only a very few were
248able to sign their name to the land title with anything but a
simple cross. According to records from the era, Manuel
Perez Nieto, owner of the “great Los Nietos rancho,”
signed a betrothal agreement in the late 1780s with the
mark of an illiterate: “+”.
After Mexico achieved its independence from Spain in
1821, many of the settlers in the far northern areas felt
greater affinity for the US than for the distant government
in Mexico City. They welcomed Anglo migrants into their
territory and entered into commercial relationships with
banks and trading houses originating in the eastern US. As
explained by historian Alberto Hurtado in Intimate
Frontiers, since many Mexican ranchers, like Nieto, were
“land-and-cattle rich, but money-poor,” they readily
entered into trade with the Anglo immigrants, who were
increasingly settling illegally in Mexican territory. Despite
the Anglos’ questionable right to do business in Mexico,
their access to cash coincided with the ranchers’ needs. In
addition, the daughters of Mexican ranchers were sought
after as marriage partners by the newly arrived Anglos,
many of whom were anxious to transform their cash
resources into landholdings and become a part of the local
gentry. For their part, the Mexican ranchers – who were
overwhelmingly mestizos and from the least educated
strata of society – looked on a marriage between their
daughters and white Anglos, who were usually literate
(although not in Spanish), as a chance to enter the white
elite. Land-rich families often married off at least one
daughter, usually before her fifteenth birthday, to an Anglo
man who was sometimes 10 to 20 years her senior and
about whose background they knew very little – so long as
he converted to Catholicism.
249According to Arcadia Bandini Brennan, a woman who
lived through this transition, “as California changed one
country’s rule to another, family holdings had to be
protected, as well as the women.” Arcadia Bandini was
married in 1825 at the age of 11 to Abel Stearns, a
45-year-old Protestant Yankee from Boston, a man even
older than her father, Juan Bandini, one of the largest
landowners in Mexican California. Arcadia explains in her
memoirs how “Don Abel” brought back presents for her
from his trips, including “some beautiful bisque dolls from
Paris, whose eyes opened and closed and limbs and head
moved. One was a baby doll.”2 The marriage, a business
transaction between two men, the Mexican Bandini and the
Anglo Stearns, had economic and political ramifications:
Stearns got land from Bandini while, according to Arcadia,
her husband “fixed things for him [her father] in a very
nice and legal way” when the Anglo courts annulled
Mexican land grants after California was admitted as a US
state. The match had met the needs of both sides, and since
Arcadia was too young to determine her future or object to
the determination made for her, her own views were
deemed of little importance. For most Mexican
landowners, however, their relationship with the Anglo
settlers would not prove advantageous.
The North American Invasion
For Mexico the mid-nineteenth-century loss of its northern
territory following war with the United States was
dramatic, brutal, and shocking. Finalized in the 1848
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the transformation and loss
had begun over 20 years earlier. Impoverished and lacking
unity after the War of Independence against Spain
250(181021), most Mexicans, including wealthy owners of
land bordering the United States, concentrated their
energies on subsistence agriculture and trade. Beginning in
1821, a transplanted Missourian, Stephen Austin, obtained
from the Mexican government the right to settle in Texas
400 families, a number that soon multiplied when others
sneaked across the border from Louisiana in hopes of
establishing cotton farms, with slaves, despite the
prohibition against slavery that Mexico had enacted
following independence from Spain. Soon the lucrative
cotton cultivation in Texas, along with the prospect of
adding a huge pro-slavery territory to the US, led
expansionist President James Polk (1795–1849) to launch
an attack on Mexico, using as an excuse the drubbing that
Texan forces had received in the famous battle of the
Alamo in San Antonio (1835). In 1847 Polk sent the US
army, under the command of General Winfield Scott
(1786–1866), not only to the independent republic of
Texas but deep into Mexican territory, all the way south to
the capital city. Despite the valor of Los Niños Heroes, the
young cadets who fell at Chapultepec on the outskirts of
Mexico City in a heroic effort to hold out against the
invaders, the Mexicans lost. Humiliated, overrun by a
superior armed force, and woefully lacking in leadership,
Mexico surrendered.
By the terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
Mexico settled for $15 million, in return for ceding
two-thirds of its northern territory to the US (Map 5.2). In
one fell swoop the US obtained most of the southwest and
California, a state that would one day be the richest and
most populous of the Union. The war concluded in 1848 is
referred to in US history books as the “Mexican American
251War,” but in the Mexican texts it is called, more
accurately, the “War of the North American Invasion.”
Notably, the saga of Mexico and the United States
exemplified the full gamut of equal and unequal
interaction from trade to settlement and eventually war,
wherein victors and losers were determined according to
relationships of race, class, and gender. The fate of many
wealthy Mexican landowners in the territories acquired by
the United States was particularly tragic, if ironic. Lulled
into believing that their future could be tied to the new
American nation with its seat in Washington DC, rather
than with distant Mexico City, wealthy Mexican ranchers
had joined with Anglos in pursuit of an independent Texas
and, for a short while, an independent California. When
the latter proved elusive or unworkable, Mexicans who had
a few decades earlier welcomed the Anglos into their
territory now found themselves in precarious
circumstances. Anglos used the US courts and blatantly
racist criteria against their Mexican neighbors, who were
stripped of their possessions, lost the titles to their ranches,
were disenfranchised, and demoted from the highest ranks
of society to the status of outsiders in their ancestral land.
Mexican landowners who thought that intermarriage with
whites had won for them elite status became targets of
racial discrimination on the part of newly triumphant
Anglos anxious to take their land.

252General López de Santa Anna
The chief figure in Mexican politics during this era was the
colorful general Antonio López de Santa Anna
(1794–1876). His long military and political career
encapsulated the various sides of caudillismo, ranging
from a heroic defense of the fatherland, in his best
moments, to periods of autocratic rule, for much of his
career. He was president of Mexico nine times and the
most important political figure from 1821 until 1855,
abdicating the office from time to time to pursue a military
career. In 1836 he led the Mexican assault on the Texas
253insurgency, defeating the rebels at the Alamo, but was
subsequently pursued and forced to concede Texas
territory to the independent Lone Star Republic. In what
became one of his most memorable exploits, Santa Anna
lost a leg during the 1838 defeat of a French invasion, and
then presided over the leg’s burial in a state funeral some
years later. Local residents reportedly would know of the
general’s stopover in a town because he would leave his
artificial leg at a blacksmith’s shop to have the silver
ornaments polished while he relaxed in a nearby tavern.
The leg was just one of the many quirks contributing to his
reputation for drama. He was a passionate fan of
cockfighting and had many roosters that he entered in
competitions with fighting cocks from all over the world.
A legendary gambler, he spent thousands of dollars on the
games and on acquiring particular fighters. Santa Anna
reached heroic status in the war with the United States in
1846, only to descend into humiliating disgrace after the
1848 loss. Following a short return to dictatorial rule from
1853 to 1855, he retreated into political obscurity, where
he remained until his death in 1876.
One particular story seems almost too emblematic of Santa
Anna’s penchant for snatching defeat from the jaws of
victory. By 1855 the former military leader had fallen out
of favor with every section of the Mexican political class,
including his formerly staunch conservative supporters. He
left the country and traveled on and off from his base in
Cuba to the United States and Europe, dabbling in various
gambling and business schemes in hopes of finding riches
or glory. On a trip to New York City in the late 1850s, he
is said to have brought with him the first shipment of
chicle, a substance that would later become the base of
254chewing gum. Santa Anna had no plans to develop
chewing gum; rather he had tried, unsuccessfully, to
convince US wheel manufacturers that chicle could be
adapted into a substance for buggy tires. Meanwhile,
James Adams, an American who served as an official US
government escort for Santa Anna when he was in the US,
began to experiment with chicle, transforming it into a
substance he named “Chiclets”. This product was then sold
as the first chewing gum. There is no record of Santa Anna
expressing any interest in what happened to the chicle he
introduced to the United States, nor did he make any
money from the product he inadvertently helped to launch.
Despite ups and downs, Santa Anna left a strong
impression on the tumultuous mid-nineteenth-century
Mexican politics, a fame shared by only two others who
held national leadership: Benito Juárez (1806–72) and
Porfirio Díaz (1830–1915). Defeat at the hands of the
North Americans and loss of such a vast amount of
Mexican territory in such a shameful (and in the eyes of
many international observers, illegal) fashion, left Santa
Anna discredited, along with the Church and conservative
landowners who had supported him. It was no secret, in
fact, that a number of powerful Mexican landowners had
sided with the US, and even considered the idea that the
US should take over Mexico.
The New Age of Imperialism
In the rest of Latin America, the late nineteenth century
was an era of intensified capital investment. In Europe and
the US manufacturing accelerated during a time of
political and economic stability, following the winding
255down of several major wars and civil strife on both sides of
the Atlantic. The restoration of trade between France and
the US, the slow modernization of post-serf Russia and
other areas to the east, and the opening of new markets in
the Far East and Latin America contributed to global
economic expansion. However, England, more than any
other nation, was poised to command the seas and flood
other nations with its manufactured goods. Spain had
tottered and fallen from a vast empire to possessing only a
couple colonies in the Americas, which also would be lost
by century’s end. Portugal had long ceased to have more
than a token role in the colonies, having ceded its influence
over Brazil to England well before independence in 1821.
France was recovering from the effects of the 1848
uprising and rebuilding its economy after the long
Napoleonic wars. Great Britain, the most advanced
manufacturing center, began to sell a wide range of goods
in traditional trading centers in Latin America, such as Rio
de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and Lima, while
exploring the feasibility of flooding smaller regional
markets with cheaper manufactured goods, especially
textiles. Absorbed with supplying a huge home market, the
United States remained an infant in international trade
until the end of the century. No competitor to England in
Europe and Asia, the US began instead to flex its
economic and political muscle in relation to the
neighboring states of Mexico and Central America, the
islands of the Caribbean, and eventually, all of South
America.
Central America and the Panama Canal
256The countries of the Central American isthmus –
Guatemala, Nicaragua, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador,
Costa Rica, and Panama – have struggled to maintain
sovereignty in the face of fairly concerted outside
interference during much of their modern history.
Fragmented and, with the exception of Costa Rica,
desperately poor, these republics have been prey to bullies
from abroad and tyrants at home. For much of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries a variety of
international governments and private firms focused on
one or another plan to construct a water route across the
narrow landmass. Although interest in cutting a canal
through the jungle of the isthmus to facilitate shipping
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans stretched as far
back as the sixteenth century, it was never considered very
seriously. When presented with the possibility, King Philip
II of Spain reportedly dismissed the plan with the
admonition that “What God hath joined together, let no
man put asunder,” extending the biblical precept for
marriage to geography. However, the 1848 discovery of
gold in California heightened interest in developing a
shorter route to the US West, reducing the time required to
circle as far south as Tierra del Fuego, or to continue the
cumbersome and costly process of unloading cargo,
portaging across the isthmus and reloading on the other
side – the only alternatives available at the time.
After the Union’s success over southern planters in the
Civil War, the newly unified US republic embarked in
earnest on a long-held expansionist dream of connecting
the country from coast to coast. The need to supply the
Pacific coast with goods, settlers, and entrepreneurs from
the burgeoning East and Midwest again raised the urgent
257need for a canal through Central America. The lucrative
investment potential was not lost on the major powers of
the time, since whoever controlled the canal would reap
considerable financial and political benefit. Thus US,
French, and British companies were all interested in
building a canal, and sent private surveying teams through
the jungle in hopes of mapping out the most favorable
route, while likewise seeking to secure the backing of a
local caudillo, or whatever government happened to be in
power. US shipping magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt
(1794–1877) had secured a concession from the
Nicaraguan government in 1840 to survey and build a
canal through that country. Navigating Nicaraguan politics
was actually as ticklish as attempting to build a water route
through the inhospitable terrain. The government was in
the hands of one or the other faction of the Liberal or
Conservative parties, and politics represented familial or
clan feuds more than any distinctive views on political and
economic policy. As a result, Vanderbilt’s agreement with
the Liberals lasted only as long as their party held power,
while the subsequent Conservative government fielded
offers from British firms.
The back-and-forth was interrupted by one of the more
peculiar episodes in the history of US intervention. In 1855
William Walker (1824–60), son of a Tennessee
fundamentalist Christian preacher and one-time
abolitionist, led an invasion of Nicaragua with 300
mercenaries left over from the US war against Mexico,
with the intention of establishing himself as President
(read “dictator”) of Nicaragua. With the complicity of the
Liberals and despite many protests from the Conservatives,
who at that time controlled the Nicaraguan government,
258Walker re-legalized slavery and installed himself as
emperor. If the US government ignored Nicaragua’s
protests, Cornelius Vanderbilt did not. The latter sent his
own set of mercenaries into the once-sovereign nation to
overthrow Walker, much to the delight of Conservatives.
Work proceeded on the canal through Nicaragua, but was
soon defeated not by politics, war, or finances, but by
yellow fever. Workers imported from China and the West
Indies, along with some natives of the region, died in such
numbers that Vanderbilt was forced to call a halt to the
embattled Nicaraguan route.
Meanwhile, the French company Ferdinand de Lesseps,
which built the Suez Canal, began digging in Panama,
which was at the time the northernmost province of
Colombia. Under the direction of the engineer Phillip
Bunau-Varilla (1859–1940), the company began to dig a
sea-level canal but soon abandoned the project because it
was far too expensive, a construction nightmare, and
ultimately unworkable. In 1889 the New Panama Canal
Company took up the project in the same area. Supplied
and even led by US military officers, a small group in
Panama led a rebellion against Colombia, ultimately
declaring war on their own government for the dubious
purpose of achieving their “independence” as a province.
The absolute hypocrisy of this claim was all the more
apparent when it became clear that the so-called
“rebellion” was nearly over before the government in
Bogotá had even learned of its existence. Hastily amassing
an army to quell the secessionist movement, Colombian
forces arrived too late and found themselves confronting
not a small provincial insurgency, but the US army.
259There was, in fact, no unified Colombian army capable of
responding to the seizure of the northern province, even
had Bogotá gotten the news earlier. From October 1899
until November 1902 the two main parties in Colombia
(Conservatives and Liberals) fought each other in a
conflict that came to be known as the “Thousand Days
War.” The struggle between the two parties built on
ongoing factional warfare that had punctuated the
Colombian landscape since the time of independence, the
reasons for which have never been entirely clear. As
mentioned in an earlier chapter, the postindependence era
saw a continuation of regional and personalist rivalries that
began as far back as the initial fighting against Spain. With
an economy based on the production of various
agricultural products, and each producer attempting to
negotiate the most favorable trade deals with foreign
markets, Colombia was by the end of the century a nation
of localized economic and political centers supporting
enclaves of producers in coffee, textiles, livestock, and
fruit production. Thus, the rivalries between Liberal and
Conservative factions did not represent strong ideological
differences as much as competing economies. In One
Hundred Years of Solitude, García Márquez presents a
“docudrama” of how the struggle was understood by
ordinary Colombians. The residents of the fictional town
of Macondo initially professed their loyalty to either the
Liberal or Conservative Party by painting their houses in
dramatic colors representative of one or the other side. As
the war dragged on, and everyone became increasingly
confused as to what each side represented, they all painted
their houses the same undefined color, demonstrating the
failure, at least in terms of ideological clarity, of either
party to offer a well-defined alternative. So it was in the
260mythical land of Macondo and, García Márquez suggests,
so it was throughout the land.
The fact that Colombia was engaged in civil war
contributed to the ease with which the US was able to
intervene and strip away the northern province. After
various attempts to end the conflict, a peace was signed on
the US battleship Wisconsin on November 21, 1902 in the
harbor off Panama. At the time of the signing US
engineering teams were surveying for a canal through the
isthmus. Colombia’s thousand days of civil war thereby
came to an end just at the time and place that Washington
had designated for the construction of the canal. It might
seem serendipitous; it was not. In an exercise of Theodore
Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” diplomacy, army gunboats docked
off the harbor while the US government promptly
recognized the sovereign nation of Panama, whose first
president was none other than Phillip Bunau-Varilla, the
canal engineer and a French citizen. In one of its first acts,
the New Panama Canal Company, located in the recently
formed “country” of Panama, signed a treaty authorized by
US Secretary of State John Hay, paying Bunau-Varilla $40
million to build the canal, for which favor Bunau-Varilla
delivered to Washington in 1903 an agreement granting to
the US the right “in perpetuity” to control the Panama
Canal. Despite Colombia’s vociferous objections to the
terms of the Hay-Bunau-Varilla treaty, and the entire
fiasco, the United States guaranteed the independence of
Panama and secured a perpetual lease on a 10-mile strip
for the canal. The newly created surrogate state of Panama
was compensated with an initial payment of $10 million
and an annuity of $250,000, beginning in 1913.
261Actual construction of the canal proved to be a massive
undertaking, far more difficult, deadly, and expensive than
the construction of the Suez Canal through desert sand.
Jungle and rock excavations cost thousands of lives, many
of them workers imported from the West Indies. So
dangerous was the work that the project for a while
generated a sordid, but nonetheless “legal,” sale in
cadavers from Panama to medical schools in the US, the
profits for which sale accrued to the Panama Railroad
Company that shipped them off. One doctor was rumored
to have accumulated, bleached, and catalogued a wide
range of skeletons for so-called “scientific study” of the
many nationalities that had participated, and died, in the
building of the canal. The waterway through the Canal
Zone opened in 1914 and remained under US control until
the 1970s, when Panamanian President Omar Torrijos
(1929–81) and US President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924)
negotiated a new agreement whereby the administration of
the canal reverted to Panamanian control on December 31,
1999.
Ecuador and the “Panama” Hat
Curiously, apart from the canal Panama may be most
associated with a hat. Actually, the hat belongs not at all to
Panama, except that it stands as a symbol of the
entrepreneurship, the importance of new international trade
routes, and the political wheeling and dealing that
surrounded the history of the canal. The canal was, after
all, an engineering wonder and a laborer’s nightmare, or at
least a creative marvel for which those who executed the
plan (the workers who dug it) were inadequately
compensated. So too are the hats. These finely woven,
262light cream-colored straw hats have been carefully sewn,
blocked, and shaped in a few towns in the highlands of
Ecuador and some other areas of the Andean Altiplano for
centuries. The first written reference to the “woven straw
hats” appears in the accounts of the Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro in the sixteenth century when he met the
people of what is today Peru. Today most genuine Panama
hats are produced in Montecristi and Cuenca in Ecuador
(Figure 5.3).
Famous for their fine weave, which provides ideal
protection from the tropical sun, the hats were prized for
their utility, comfort, and style. The US army bought
10,000 Ecuadoran hats for the men stationed in Cuba at the
turn of the century, while other thousands were sold by
itinerant peddlers in Colombia and other countries adjacent
to Ecuador throughout the nineteenth century. The
Ecuadorian hats became identified with Panama when
travelers passing through the isthmus on their way to and
from the gold fields of California purchased them and
brought them to both ends of the US continent as a
“souvenir of Panama.” By the time the canal was being
dug in the first decade of the twentieth century, the straw
hats from Ecuador were standard on the heads of workers
depicted in photographs of the gigantic construction
project that appeared in newspapers throughout the world.
On his November 1906 visit to the canal excavation,
then-President Theodore Roosevelt was photographed at
the controls of a huge Bucyrus steam shovel wearing a
“Panama” hat, as were the other workers and onlookers in
the picture (Figure 5.4). No matter how many corrections
and clarifications from Ecuadorians, then as now, the hat
would forever be associated with Panama.
263In many ways the story of the hat parallels the history of
uneven exchange characteristic of most Latin American
exports. A master weaver can take as long as eight months
to weave a hat, using for the finest hats the best fronds
from the toquilla palm tree. Many of the best weavers, who
live in villages as far as 100 miles from Montecristi, sell a
single hat of the highest quality to buyers for
approximately $200.
Figure 5.3 Saint James the Great as a Moor-killer
(Santiago de Matamoros), painting by an unknown artist of
the Cuzco school, presumably seventeenth century. The
painting, and others that survive in Ecuador and Peru,
show the early conquistadores wearing headgear that was
later dubbed a “Panama” hat.
264Figure 5.4 US President Theodore Roosevelt at the
construction of the Panama Canal. The New York Times
photograph of Roosevelt wearing a white hat while on a
steam shovel at the Panama Canal on November 15, 1906
appeared in newspapers throughout the world, supposedly
265giving rise to the label “Panama hat.” (Courtesy Theodore
Roosevelt Collection, Harvard College Library)
The hat then passes through five more people who finish
the brim, shape it, remove imperfections, bleach the straw,
and add interior and exterior bands. Since a classic woven
hat retails outside Ecuador for anywhere from $450 to
266$10,000, depending on the quality, the best hats sell for
two to five times more than one master weaver is paid for
his eight months of work. Given the time and skill
involved, and the encroaching competition from
low-quality copies made in China and other parts of the
world – and, interestingly, that the market for Panama hats
in Ecuador has lost out to the ubiquitous baseball cap – the
production and sale of high-quality Panamas is
disappearing. A fine craft and the livelihoods of a line of
artisans and other entrepreneurs in the commodity chain
are likewise coming to an end. What, one might ask, will
replace the creations and the trade in hats from the towns
of Ecuador for the next generations?
Independence at Last? Cuba and Puerto Rico
The Panama Canal and the Ecuadorian hat that has since
been associated with it illustrate nineteenth-century
changes in hemispheric political and economic
relationships. If Latin America suffered from
fragmentation, localism, and weak central governments,
the US was poised to take advantage of the disunity in the
South. A consolidated post-Civil War US with capital to
spare looked to its own territory and that of neighbors to
feed its ravenously hungry industrial appetite. In fact, one
of the most egregious examples of US gunboat diplomacy
was its late nineteenth-century war with Spain to acquire
that nation’s possessions in the Caribbean and far Pacific.
The most important was Cuba, a country that President
John Quincy Adams had voiced an interest in annexing
since as early as 1823. That was the year of the Monroe
Doctrine, a US statement that claimed the hemisphere for
the Americans, warning out European interference. Its use
267over the centuries has been to promote US dominance
more than exclude European intervention and as such
demonstrates the difference between Britain’s role in the
Americas and that of the United States. Even if England’s
trading and investment relationship with Latin America,
especially Argentina, seemed to place the latter at a
disadvantage, it was an interaction based on trade. For the
US in the nineteenth century, securing stable and reliable
trading partners began to merge with direct political
intervention.
Throughout the nineteenth century US business interests
were intensely involved in Cuban affairs, mainly because
from 1850 onward the small island was the world’s leading
sugar producer and the US its most important customer.
US capital was heavily invested in Cuba’s mills,
transportation and communication networks, and all
aspects of the sugar economy. When Creole planters
moved to end the parasitical control that Spain held over
the island, preferring instead to develop their own trading
partners, the power vacuum that resulted opened
opportunities for more direct US intervention. Taking
advantage of a naval revolt in the Spanish port city of
Cadiz that resulted in the temporary overthrow of the
Spanish monarchy and installation of a republic, Cuban
patriots declared independence on October 10, 1868.
Despite Spain’s weakness, the imperial power refused to
accede to the Cuban Creoles’ demands for self-rule,
instead launching a strong retaliatory force against the
independence movement and playing on fears among
Creole elites that Cuba without Spain would become
another Haiti. The Ten Years’ War raged from 1868 until
1878, cost the Cubans over 250,000 lives, inflicted major
268damage on the sugar industry, and – except for beginning
the gradual abolition of slavery (met with ambivalence by
many Creole planters) – ended with no significant change
in the colonial relationship.
One key result, however, was increased interest by US
sugar trusts in restoring the island’s profitable exports. The
initial independence movement was quashed during the
patriots’ defeat in both the Ten Years’ War and the
subsequent Guerra Chiquita (“Little War”) from 1875 to
1880, but the events brought to prominence a number of
important Cuban leaders, foremost of whom was José
Martí, considered the “Father of the Cuban Nation.” From
exile in New York, the charismatic poet, essayist, literary
figure, and political activist had waged a tireless war in the
pages of US newspapers, calling for independence from
Spain. He was the founder of the Cuban Revolutionary
Party in 1892 and participated in the patriots’ 1895
invasion of the island, where he died in a skirmish with
Spanish forces. The most important military commander
was General Antonio Maceo Grajales (1845–96), the man
known as the “Bronze Titan” in reference to both his
military genius and his African heritage. General Maceo
led an army of mainly Afro-Cuban soldiers against far
larger Spanish forces, chalking up impressive victories
with a guerrilla warfare strategy for over 20 years. He
entered the rebel army as a private in 1868, rising to the
rank of general and chief military officer in a less than a
decade. Despite Creole fears that independence would
result in a black republic on the Haitian model, and
unfavorable comparisons with the black generals of Haiti,
Maceo maintained his command because he was an expert
officer. Like Martí, General Maceo died in battle, killed in
269a Spanish ambush in 1896. While interpretations that place
the entire course of history on the shoulders of individual
figures should be viewed with great caution, Cuba may be
the exception. Both Maceo and Martí were tremendously
important political figures whose reputations as patriots,
and whose political and military expertise, earned them
enormous respect from their followers. Their leadership
and stature might have been capable of offsetting the
conservative Creoles’ eventual surrender in the face of the
US intervention. It was not to be, however.
In the midst of the renewed Cuban independence struggle,
powerful US interests sought to acquire Cuba. Pushed by
President William McKinley’s expansionist Republican
Party, urged on by sugar interests, and propagandized
widely by the William Randolph Hearst newspaper
conglomerate, the US declared war on Spain after a
dubious incident that resulted in the explosion of the US
battleship Maine in Havana harbor. The cause of the
explosion remains unclear – whether a spark in the ship’s
powder magazine, a harbor mine, or sabotage by
provocateurs linked with the US sugar interests or the
Hearst newspapers – the result was the same. The
jingoistic “yellow press,” especially Joseph Pulitzer of the
New York Tribune, screamed for revenge; Teddy
Roosevelt sought to use the incident as a political platform
from which to oppose McKinley; and demonstrations
erupted in the streets of American cities calling for war
with Spain.
Exhausted after over 20 years of war, Spain was able to
mount little resistance against the fierce onslaught of
Cuban independence forces. Indeed, the Spanish were
270widely regarded to be on the verge of defeat when the US
intervened in what the Secretary of State called “a splendid
little war.” Teddy Roosevelt finally got the recognition he
craved by leading his volunteer troop of Rough Riders on
the island, although his “triumphant” seizure of San Juan
Hill (resulting in the loss of 76 percent of his combatants,
three times the losses of the Spanish) was opposed by the
regular military officer in charge. Despite their
competence on the battlefield, the US excluded Cubans
from the formal peace negotiations, and signed the Treaty
of Paris with Spain on December 10, 1898. Washington
declared its own terms, which included controlling Cuba as
a self-governing protectorate, forcing on the latter all the
administrative burdens but none of the benefits of
sovereignty (see Box 5.1). US Army General Leonard
Wood was appointed governor and charged with
overseeing the terms of the new Cuban Constitution, a
document that only met with US approval after the
addition of the Platt Amendment. The latter granted the US
the right to intervene at will to maintain whatever
government it chose on the island and required Cuba to
sell or lease land for US military bases. This was the origin
of the Guantánamo military base at one end of the Cuban
island, which housed an infamous US federal prison after
the September 11, 2001 attacks on the New York World
Trade Center.
The tiny island of Puerto Rico was a neighbor to Cuba and
experienced a similar turn of historical events. As one of
Spain’s earliest possessions, it developed into a prosperous
sugar and tobacco colony over the succeeding 400 years.
Like Cuba, Puerto Rico imported African slaves to work
on sugar plantations and, in the mid-nineteenth century,
271brought in increasing numbers of Chinese indentured
servants as laborers, especially in tobacco. The
independence movement in Puerto Rico also paralleled
Cuba’s, but owing to its much smaller size was never as
powerful or ideologically cohesive. In the Grito de Lares,
September 23, 1868, a group of Creole planters under the
leadership of Ramón Betances rose in revolt against the
Spanish Crown. But just as Spain was ready to grant
Puerto Rico functional sovereignty, including
representatives to the Spanish Parliament and an elected
governor, the US intervened in Cuba and declared war on
Spain. Although Puerto Rico already had a sovereign
parliament in session on July 17, 1898, and an elected
governor, the US invaded the southernmost city of Ponce,
raised the Stars and Stripes, and declared Puerto Rico to be
free from Spain – a colonial power that was essentially no
longer even claiming it. According to the terms of the
Treaty of Paris that ended the “conflict,” Puerto Rico
became a possession of the United States.
Determined to prevent Cuban independence fighters from
obtaining control over their homeland (highlighting the
unfortunate vacuum in Cuban leadership wrought by the
deaths of Martí and Maceo), General Wood installed in
power the most conservative planters: Creoles who had
resisted independence from Spain, opposed the abolition of
slavery, and were comfortable with US domination so long
as their profits were secure. The US army patrolled a
compliant Cuba, ushering the small country even more
fully into the economic sphere of its powerful northern
neighbor.
272To their credit, some from within the ranks of US political
and intellectual circles heard the protests of the Cuban
patriots and voiced their disapproval of this new,
heavy-handed US imperialism. The eloquence of Carl
Schurz (1829–1906), a founding member of the
Republican Party, stands in sharp contrast to the malleable
McKinley or the grandstanding Teddy Roosevelt (see Box
5.2). Schurz declared: “We hold that the policy known as
imperialism is hostile to liberty and tends toward
militarism, an evil from which it has been our glory to be
free. We regret that it has become necessary in the land of
Washington and Lincoln to reaffirm that all men, of
whatever race or color, are entitled to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.”3 The writer Mark Twain
(1835–1910) suggested that the US should remake the flag
befitting its new role in the world: remove the traditional
stars and stripes, paint the white stripes black, and replace
the stars with a skull and crossbones. Piracy reigned again
in the Caribbean, but the new pirates were bearing the flag
of a powerful expanding nation.
Box 5.1 Yellow journalism
The US public formed its impressions of Cuba and
other parts of Latin America through many articles
and cartoons that depicted the Cuban people as
needing US intervention to “save” it from Spain.
The cartoon shown here (Figure 5.5) depicts Cuba
as an unruly (black) child recklessly shunning
Uncle Sam who holds a wellbehaved (white)
273Puerto Rican child, docilely accepting US
protection.
Figure 5.5 Discontent with Cuban political and
business leaders led to a rebellion against the first
independent government in July 1906. The US
media claimed Cuba here depicted in a racist
stereotype as a reckless gunslinger and a child –
was unable to govern itself, while Puerto Rico –
which was under direct US control – is seen as
docile and stable.
274Box 5.2 1898 San Juan Hill: Teddy Roosevelt
Eduardo Galeano wrote of these events:
Brandishing his Stetson, Teddy Roosevelt gallops
at the head of his “Rough Riders;” and when he
descends San Juan Hill he carries, crumpled in his
275hand, a Spanish flag. He will take all the glory for
this battle which opens the way to Santiago de
Cuba. Of the Cubans who also fought, no journalist
will write a word...
To make a quick end to the Cuban war, Teddy has
proposed that a North American squadron should
flatten Cadiz and Barcelona with its guns; but
Spain, exhausted from so much warfare against the
Cubans, surrenders in less than four months. From
San Juan Hill, the victorious Teddy Roosevelt
gallops at top speed to the governorship of New
York State and on to the presidency of the United
States. This fanatical devotee of a God who prefers
gunpowder to incense takes a deep breath and
writes: No triumph of peace is quite so great as the
supreme triumph of war.
Within a few years, he will receive the Nobel
Peace Prize.
Quoted in Galeano, Faces and Masks, II, p. 248.
At the opening of the twentieth century, the Monroe
Doctrine, President James Monroe’s 1823 assertion that
the United States would oppose European imperialism and
recolonization schemes in the Americas, had become a
vital tool for US interference in the internal affairs of the
sovereign nations of the hemisphere. The most
conspicuous sign of the US “coming of age” as an
emerging power on the world stage was President
276Theodore Roosevelt’s speech in 1904, proclaiming US
hegemony in the Americas. This statement, known as the
“Roosevelt Corollary,” came to be seen as an additional
rationale for the principles contained in the Monroe
Doctrine. Latin American nations had always viewed the
Monroe Doctrine with suspicion – especially since Great
Britain, not the US, had supported their anti-colonial
struggle. However, the Doctrine had little bite so long as
their northern neighbor remained a minor power. When the
US emerged from the Spanish-American War with the
might, and the hubris, to hold the European nations in
check, it became clear that business and political interests
intent on intervening in Latin America’s affairs now had
the upper hand.
Conclusion
This chapter has presented a few examples of commodities
whose production and sale transformed the society that
produced them. We have seen that as opposed to a bare
export–import statistic, there is a social history associated
with the production of a commodity in a given time and
place, just as there is a corresponding social history
associated with its consumption. One of the key
components of the commodity chain was the rise of the
United States as a major consumer power. The imperial
muscle from the United States proved a formidable
obstacle to Caribbean and Central American sovereignty,
as nationalism ran aground under the weight of its northern
neighbor.
Similarly, economic and political forces that benefited
from the alliance with the emerging US elite stood at the
277Latin American end of the “two-way bridge.” The
Peruvian government oversaw an impressive influx of
revenue during the guano boom, but failed to remain
prosperous, losing out to Chilean nitrates by century’s end.
Coffee became a staple of Colombian and Brazilian
exporters, providing for Brazil sufficient revenues to
finance heavy industrialization, when combined with
foreign capital investment. In Colombia coffee exports
generated income in specific regions that led to a more
dispersed economic development and federated pattern of
political power. Mexico struggled to create an independent
republic only to lose over half of its territory to the
expanding US. The next chapter examines the dramatic
social and demographic changes that arose in countries
that were increasingly urban, industrial, and contentious.
2786
Immigration, and Urban and Rural Life
During the final decades of the nineteenth century and
early years of the twentieth, the countries of Latin America
underwent significant demographic changes, similar to
those that swept the United States and Canada. According
to Thomas Holloway, from the 1880s until 1930
approximately 10 million immigrants from Europe and the
Near East entered Latin America, arriving from Italy,
Spain, Portugal, and Germany, along with Christians from
the old Ottoman Empire states of Syria and Lebanon (who
were, and still are, misnamed “Turks” from the time they
arrived in the new lands). Leaving behind poverty, civil
strife, persecution, and hunger in hopes of finding a better
life in the “New World,” most immigrants poured into the
Southern Cone countries of Argentina, Uruguay, and
Chile, as well as southern Brazil and to a lesser extent
other Latin American and Caribbean nations. By 1895
more than 80 percent of laborers in Buenos Aires were
foreign-born, as was a quarter of the nation’s entire
population of 4 million. Over the next few decades, from
1890 to 1916 – with the exception of World War I
(1914–18) when emigration from Europe was suspended –
2.9 million immigrants entered Argentina, mainly from
Italy.
Uruguay was the only country of Latin America that had
attracted an earlier wave of immigrants, mainly from
Spain, France, and Italy, so that as early as 1850 the popu￾lation of Montevideo was over half foreign-born. In
279addition, Uruguay underwent explosive population growth
in the late nineteenth century as a result of immigration, a
high birth rate, and low death rate. Sparsely populated at
the start of the century, Uruguay grew from a total of
70,000 inhabitants in 1830 to 450,000 in 1900. Like
neighboring Argentina, Uruguay continued to attract
immigrants during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries; however, the percentage of foreign-born
remained lower because of the rapid rate of natural
increase. Nonetheless Uruguay also became a country
whose population increasingly traced its ancestry back to
Europe, rather than to indigenous roots, like Mexico and
the Andean nations, or to Africa and Asia, like Brazil.
Between 1890 and 1920 the city of São Paulo in southern
Brazil grew nearly tenfold (from 65,000 to 600,000) with
the arrival of immigrants from Portugal, Italy, Spain, the
Middle East, and Japan. Motivated by a desire to “whiten”
the population and hold in check demands for higher
wages following the abolition of slavery in 1888, Brazilian
private organizations, with government backing,
encouraged European immigration. The Society for the
Promotion of Immigration in São Paulo and the Rio de
Janeiro Central Immigration Society, among others,
publicized opportunities for workers in Brazil by
distributing handbills in villages and towns in Italy and
other countries rimming the Mediterranean, offering free
passage and steady work at good wages in Brazil’s coffee
fields to potential emigrants. Chile also attracted about
100,000 immigrants, especially to the port city of
Valparaiso and the capital, Santiago.
Asian Immigration
280Apart from those who came from the Middle East, the
principal non-European immigrants to Latin America came
from China (destined for Cuba, Central America, Mexico,
Peru, and Brazil) or Japan (to Brazil and Peru). Following
the abolition of black slavery in the Caribbean colonies in
the 1830s, both the British and Dutch colonial
governments imported indentured servants from South
Asia to British Guiana (renamed Guyana after
independence in 1966), Trinidad & Tobago, Surinam, and
Curação with the intention of depressing the price of labor
and quelling demands for better working conditions among
recently freed slaves. Walter Rodney, in his study of the
Guyanese working class, points to a colonial policy of
taking land from black freed persons and giving it to
Indians after the latter had completed their indenture,
thereby literally “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” When East
Indian immigration to the Caribbean ended in 1917, some
250,000 had settled in Guyana; others were brought to
Martinique and a few of the French islands, but did not
stay. By 1940 the Dutch colonial government had settled
33,000 Javanese indentured servants in Surinam and
Curação, bringing them from their colonies in Indonesia.
Tensions between the descendants of African and Indian
immigrants have played a significant role in the political
and economic life of both Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago.
During the second half of the nineteenth century about a
quarter of a million Chinese, overwhelmingly men,
migrated to Cuban sugar plantations where they worked as
inden- tured servants alongside African slaves. Similarly,
Chinese “coolies” worked in the guano fields of Peru and
on the construction of the Andean railroad. Some of these
laborers eventually left the minefields and rural estates to
281take up work in urban areas as trades- men, in restaurants,
and in the service sector, where, given the extreme gender
imbalance, they married non-Chinese women and
eventually were absorbed into the mestizo population. As
the US began to limit Asian immigration in the early
twentieth century, proceeding to cut it off entirely in the
1920s, Chinese immigrants re-routed to Mexico, heading
there directly from China or after a stop in California. By
the second decade of the twentieth century, over 25,000
Chinese had entered Mexico, where they achieved
moderate success in small businesses, intellectual circles,
and the government bureaucracy. As more Chinese
achieved middle-class status, resentment arose among
other Mexicans and outbreaks of anti-Asian rioting
erupted, reaching a high point in 1929 when the entire
Chinese population was expelled from the northern state of
Sonora.
Japanese immigration to Peru and Brazil took place at the
turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, crested
during the years between World Wars I and II, and then
tapered off in subsequent decades, but did not end until the
1960s. Similar to the pattern established earlier by the
Chinese, Japanese migrants worked as indentured servants,
although their contracts were shorter; the migration
process was more closely monitored by the home
government in Japan to avoid the most egregious abuses;
and, while small in number, women migrated along with
men. Having greater opportunities to form marriages
among themselves, fewer Japanese intermarried with the
Peruvian and Brazilian population, resulting in a more
intact transmigration of culture and language from Japan to
the new homelands. Free immigrants, not coming under
282indentured contracts, also entered Peru and Brazil until the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 halted migration.
Under pressure from the United States, Peru even expelled
over 1,300 Japanese from its territory, sending them to
internment camps in Texas during the war.
The greatest flow of people from Asia to Latin America
was the movement of Japanese to Brazil. Prompted by
planters anxious to recruit low-wage workers in the wake
of abolition, politicians from the state of São Paulo
prevailed on the Brazilian government to lift an earlier ban
on Asian immigration. Between 1908 and 1961 approxi￾mately 250,000 nikkei (first-generation Japanese migrants)
settled in the states of São Paulo, Paraná, Mato Grosso,
and Pará. Today their numbers have increased to 800,000,
making the community the largest concentration of
Japanese outside their homeland. Return migrants from
Brazil currently comprise a sizeable number of recent
immigrants to Japan (Figure 6.1).
European Immigration
Other distinct migration patterns emerged at the turn of the
last century. From 1902 until 1916 approximately 400,000
mainly Spanish immigrants entered Cuba, which likewise
received large numbers of Chinese. Paraguay, for its part,
attempted to attract settlers in hopes of building up its
population after the losses incurred during the War of the
Triple Alliance (see Chapter 4). Paraguay encouraged
settlements of French, English, Russians, German
Mennonites, and others, offering tracts of free land and
free passage from the old country. However, in the face of
Paraguay’s devastated post-war economy, very poor
283administration, and limited ability to incorporate new
arrivals into a country lacking public services, regional
markets, road networks, communication and rail lines,
most of the immigrant communities failed as rural
settlements. Large numbers of the new arrivals either
returned home or moved on to cities in Argentina, Brazil,
and Uruguay (see Figure 6.2).
The pattern of internal migration from the countryside to
cities was more pro- nounced in some countries than
others, depending often on the prosperity, or lack thereof,
of the rural area in question. In many cases the landholding
elite blocked the passage of land reform legislation that
would have divided the big estates, offering unused
portions of land to immigrants for settlement. In others,
governments made land available, but the lack of roads
and infrastructure limited its appeal to all but the most
intrepid. As a result immigrants were discouraged from
making a go of it on their own, forced instead to work on
the large estates and accept whatever meager wage was
offered. Nonetheless, the harsh climate, isolation, and
semi-feudal working con- ditions in the pampas (flat
plains) of Argentina, the coffee plantations and rural areas
of Brazil, and on ranches in Uruguay and Chile
encouraged migrants to abandon the countryside and move
to cities to take jobs in manufacturing, transportation, and
com- munication networks; on urban development
projects; and in the expanding commercial and government
sectors. The cities grew, along with a new urban culture,
beginning a trend toward urbanization that stands as one of
the key features of Latin American societies today.

The Southern Cone
The impetus for the growth of manufacturing, and the
migration of millions of people from Europe and Asia to
fill jobs in the Americas, stemmed from the dramatic
transformation underway in the industrial economies of
Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America. When the
patriots met in Tucumán in 1816 to form the new
Argentine nation – then named the United Provinces of the
River Plate – England stood ready to supply the new state
with goods, talent, capital, and people. Very much in need
of hides for leather goods and shoes, as well as machine
belts for factories, wool and cotton to feed the mills of its
burgeoning textile industry, and meat and grain to feed its
285rapidly expand- ing population, England viewed Argentina
as a crucial trading partner.
Figure 6.2 Migration to Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and
Uruguay, 1871–1924.
Unlike Germany and France, which had greater access to
agricultural goods within their borders, Britain could not
feed and clothe itself autonomously – especially because
for generations the peasantry had been moved from the
countryside into the city to labor in the “workshop of the
world,” as the seat of empire was known. Moreover,
286England stood in stark contrast to the United States, a
rising power that was developing its industry and trade
from its own ample supply of cotton, hides, grains, and
foodstuffs, obtained from the land it was conquering “from
shore to shore.” Likewise, the US had a natural market for
processed goods among the immigrants pouring in to
participate in that settlement, as well as displacing the
Native Americans. By contrast, England was a tiny island
nation that looked out beyond its borders, took from afar,
sold to the world, and in so doing claimed the sea as its
own domain. Eric Hobsbawm has remarked that Britain
was, at its height, the most globalized of world powers and
“in some senses even more global than the US now, as it
single-handedly controlled the oceans to an extent to
which no country now controls the skies.”1
A sign on the Delaware River Bridge outside Trenton,
New Jersey reads: “Trenton Makes – The World Takes.”
Now an anachronism for the twenty-first-century rust-belt
city that stands as a mere shell of what US industrial might
used to signify, that terse phrase cuts to the heart of
international trade from the perspective of an advanced
cap- italist state. A variation on those words could have
graced a billboard outside Leeds, or Sheffield, Manchester
or London in the nineteenth century: “Britain Makes – The
World Takes.” No Latin American nation complemented
England’s expansionist, free market, neocolonial designs
as well as Argentina. The country seemed tailor-made to
fit into England’s economic, political, and cultural milieu
as a supplier of primary goods and recipient of finished
manufactures. Buenos Aires was Argentina’s lone city of
significant trade and enterprise in the nineteenth century;
the rest of the country was, and to some extent still is, an
287expanse of flat plains. Smaller provincial cities served as
collection points for goods, which were then passed on to
the port of Buenos Aires over roads that spread out like
spokes from the hub at the port to distant provinces.
Argentina, it must have seemed, was a land sitting in wait
for the call of the industri- alizing world on the other side
of the ocean.
Post-independence Argentina was a geographical, political,
and even cultural unit with enormous potential to
complement Britain’s needs. After 1825 Anglo-Argentine
trade was conducted on the “most favored nation”
principle, allowing England the greatest advantage in
availing itself of Argentine goods. Under the strong-arm
rule of Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires
and later dictator on and off from 1826 until 1852,
Argentina became firmly established as an export-oriented
agricul- tural economy. Ranchers, or estancieros,
consolidated their control by century’s end, under the
political leadership of Julio Argentino Roca (1843–1914),
also known as “the Fox.” Roca (not to be confused with
Rosas, although they shared a penchant for dictatorial
rule), along with other regional caudillos, launched a
genocidal “ethnic cleans- ing” to clear the indigenous
people from the plains, much like their counterparts in
North America. The Argentine campaign that ended in
1880 came to be known as the “Conquest of the Desert,”
and resulted in Roca selling off or giving away large tracts
of land to his military officers and supportive estancieros.
But unlike the process in the western US, removal of
indigenous people from the Argentine pampas was not
accompanied by a homesteading policy to settle individual
288farmers on arable plots of land. Instead, Roca’s late
nineteenth-century giveaway to the ranchers effectively
sealed off the prospects of establishing a class of small
farmers linked to the domestic economy, capable of
supporting self-sufficient urban growth. What resulted,
however, meshed perfectly with British trade and
investment designs, as well as the interests of the
landowning elite. Argentina’s immense grasslands were
capable of providing an endless supply of foodstuffs,
hides, and wool, so long as Europe supplied technology,
capital, and labor. The introduction of steam vessels cut
the shipping time between the ports of England and
Buenos Aires in half. Added to that, newly developed
refrigeration methods allowed for the transport of fresh
meat in place of the jerked and salted beef that had
previously been the only method of preserv- ing perishable
foodstuffs during the many weeks of voyage. British banks
and investors readily stepped in with financial assistance to
build the infrastructure and manufacturing base, including
railroads, roads, port facilities, banks, insurance firms,
packing houses, and utilities.
The final obstacle standing in the way of Argentina’s
entrance into the commodity chain was an adequate supply
of labor. Work in the traditional ranching sector had
required little labor, mainly a few cowboys (gauchos) to
oversee thousands of acres of land. But processing raw
materials for export; the manufacture of foods, beverages,
and textiles; and the construction of railroads and buildings
called for thousands of workers, of which Argentina was in
short supply. Thus began the massive influx of European
immigrants who over the next decades overwhelmed the
mestizo and Afro-Argentine population, at least in the
289coastal zones, to the point of disappearance. Sixty percent
of Argentina’s population growth was from immigrants,
pushing the popu- lation upward from1.8 million in 1869
to 8 million in 1914. Five million immigrants poured into
Buenos Aires and coastal cities, provincial towns, and
some farms, leav- ing Argentina with a population that
traces its origins mainly to northern Italy and Spain, with a
smattering of other nationalities, including French,
Germans, and Russians (the latter mainly Jews). By 1880
the Carnival flags of Italy, Spain, and other European
nations had replaced the banners of the black clubs (see
Figure 6.3).
Life on the Pampas
Although most immigrants settled in Buenos Aires
(residents of which are called porteños, or port dwellers)
and a few other urban centers, some of the original
immigrants attempted to make a living off the land.
Escaping desperate poverty in Italy, immigrants in the
1880s were mainly illiterate, unskilled men who traveled
two to four weeks in the bottom of a crowded boat, with
little food and poor sanitation, to work during the harvests.
Many came as tenant farmers, working either as
sharecroppers or as paid laborers for absentee landowners
on large, isolated plots of land far from the coast and urban
centers. Some of the laborers moved back and forth
between Italy and Argentina, their steerage-class fares
costing about two week’s wages. Called golondrinas –
meaning swallows, for the bird that is known to return to
the same locale each season – these men hailed from small
villages in northern Italy and eventually settled down on
one or the other side of the Atlantic.
290Life on the pampas was dismal and lonely; thus it is no
wonder the majority of settlers eventually migrated to
cities for more permanent employment, if they stayed in
Argentina at all. The transient laborer built his dwelling of
mud within a rectangle measured out on the ground;
saplings marked the poles of the four corners to provide a
makeshift frame, and walls were plastered with a mixture
of dirt, water, and manure, with straw woven into the mix
for stability. Topped with a roof of straw thatch (replaced
in subsequent years by galvanized steel), this dwelling of
10–12 square feet with a door, and maybe a couple of
openings for windows, served as the new immi- grant’s
home, often for a season and sometimes for a whole year.
A few of the men paired with indigenous and mestizo
women from the few settlements scattered on the pampas
and raised families. Little is known of these families since
they left almost no settled communities with schools or
stores, and only occasionally attended church. With little
chance of owning property, most immigrants moved to
cities or returned to Europe. A tiny fraction managed to
buy land, and even prospered, but they were the exception.
Overall, Argentina’s history of immigration is associated
with urban growth and city life, where the new arrivals
found opportunities, jobs, education, and social life, all of
which were absent in the rural areas.

291British Investment
Except for periodic worldwide depressions in the 1890s,
the Anglo-Argentine alliance worked out well for both
sides. In 1889 British capital in Argentina accounted for
nearly half of that nation’s entire overseas investment. For
its part, in the late nineteenth century Argentina rose to be
the foremost corn exporter in the world, second in wheat
and near the top in mutton, wool, hides, and beef. From
1860 to 1914 Argentina’s GDP (gross domestic product)
grew at an annual average rate of at least five percent, one
of the longest recorded rates of sustained growth. But over
the long term this period of growth did not prove to be
completely advantageous to Argentina, or at least not to a
majority of its citizens. The country’s traditional elite was
more interested in over- seeing vast country estates,
attending horse races and polo matches, and entertaining
themselves than in taking on the complicated and
292sometimes messy task of running the country, building
infrastructure, and ensuring an autonomous future. The
label “Argentine Playboy” might have been the precursor
to today’s “jet set,” while the phrase, “rich as an
Argentine” entered the lexicon in Europe and America in
reference to the Argentine oligarchy’s demonstrative pride
in having the richest jockey club in the world and horse
races with the finest thoroughbreds.
Buenos Aires flourished as a result of both foreign
investment and the vitality that immigrants brought to its
economic and social base. From 1900 to 1929, more than
one-third (35 percent) of Argentina’s total fixed
investment came from foreigners, mostly English banks
and private firms. Immigrants to cities took jobs in urban
construction, built new buildings, paved streets, widened
avenues, and helped to construct an impressive system of
parks, plazas, and pathways. In the manufacturing sector
immi- grants filled jobs in processing plants and packing
houses, both inside the city and in the suburban industrial
belt cropping up around it. Finally, the influx of such an
enor- mous number of people stimulated internal economic
growth as the domestic demand for food, clothing,
transportation, housing, household goods, and other
necessities of daily life kept pace with urban expansion.
Nonetheless, growing dependence on for- eign investment
disturbed political nationalists who foresaw the danger of
tying the nation’s economic health to outside interests. But
their voices were drowned out in the euphoria of
seemingly endless prosperity.
Uruguay, Argentina’s neighbor across the Rio de la Plata
estuary, likewise attracted large amounts of British
293investment capital, which grew more than fivefold in less
than 20 years, from an estimated £6.5 million in 1884 to
£40 million in 1900. Although Uruguay was not a
large-scale recipient of capital in comparison with
Britain’s other investments, the impact of British money
was significant when compared to domestic capital
investment. With little competition, English firms were
able to dictate favorable concessions from the government
for constructing rail lines to designated estancias in the
interior that provided mutton, hides, and wool to the export
market. In Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay British
companies largely built the railroads and financed the
urban infrastructure, including water, transit networks,
telephone, gas, and tram lines. In Montevideo foreign
firms bankrolled most government expenses involved in
managing the expanding commercial and political
bureaucracy. Unlike Argentina and Brazil, however, a
large sector of Uruguayan society and members of the
govern- ment became fearful of losing the nation’s
autonomy to the British overseers quite early on. In the
face of criticism of the high cost and inefficiency of public
services, by the beginning of the twentieth century
Uruguay’s political elite instituted strict controls over
foreign investment, passed protectionist legislation, and
encouraged domestic manufacturing.
The Changing Cultural Landscape
In addition to their impact on the economy, the large-scale
presence of immigrants had a decisive effect on the
cultural landscape of many Latin American countries.
Recent arrivals poured into ramshackle tenements in the
largely Italian neighborhood of La Boca in Buenos Aires,
294after a long day’s labor frequenting and running small
grocery stores, shoe repair shops, cafés and bars,
barbershops, card parlors, dance halls and brothels.
Music and dance
On the streets of La Boca was born one of Argentina’s
best-known contributions to world culture: the tango.
Developed in lower-class Italian immigrant dance halls, it
was shunned by the porteño elite and barred from being
performed in downtown social gatherings because its
sensual moves and lascivious lyrics were considered far
too bawdy for the general public (meaning the aesthetic of
the refined upper classes). Around 1905 Argentine émigrés
to France are known to have introduced the tango in the
cafés and dance halls of Paris, where it became quite
popular. A so-called “tangomania” gripped European cities
by 1914 and the onset of World War I. Acceptance in
Paris, along with the spread of sheet music to Argentina,
led to a reintroduction of tango to the Buenos Aires elite.
In keeping with their proclivity to ape anything approved
in Europe, the cultivated porteño upper and middle classes
embraced tango music and dance, moving it from the back
streets of working-class barrios to the front parlors of
apartments and clubs in the wealthy neighborhoods of
Recoleta and Barrio Norte (Figure 6.4).
A similar pattern of rejection, followed by ultimate
acceptance, occurred with the Brazilian samba. Born in the
slave quarters of the Brazilian northeast and spreading to
the cities of the coast, especially Salvador da Bahia and
Rio de Janeiro, the rhyth- mic dance and music flourished
in the social milieu of former slaves during the early
295decades of the twentieth century. In the favelas
(shantytowns) and working-class neighborhoods that
cropped up in Brazil’s expanding urban centers, blacks
came together at private parties and outdoor bars,
affectionately called botequims, to play music on an
assortment of homemade instruments. The first formal
organization of samba dancers, singers, and
instrumentalists was established in 1928. The organizers
called it an escola de samba, or samba school, probably in
hopes of establishing legitimacy for the dance and musical
form by associating the concept of a dancehall with a
school, a place of discipline, hard work, and learning.
These clubs, or schools, became the foun- dation from
which samba emerged as a major cultural force in all urban
areas, but especially in Rio de Janeiro. The schools grew
out of the loose network of revelers called blocos de sujo,
literally “groups of dirty ones,” who paraded through the
streets at Carnival time, the week before the onset of Lent.
As Afro-Brazilian musical culture grew, it attached itself
to the pre-Lenten parties that were a tradition among the
Portuguese, Italian, and other Catholic immigrants from
Europe.

296Not everyone from the white elite and immigrant
communities welcomed the entrance of Afro-Brazilian
culture on the national scene. In urban areas former slaves
who poured into cities to get away from the drudgery of
the countryside were met with hostility from whites. One
297particular method of driving out black culture, if not the
peo- ple themselves, was passage of a number of laws that
sought to prohibit the practice of non-Christian religions
and any public expression of black music and dance. This
prohibition coincided with efforts by immigration
authorities to exclude or actively dis- courage non-white
immigrants from entering the country. Nevertheless, in the
early 1930s the samba schools were officially recognized
as participants in the citywide Carnival festivities. The
mainly black and poor sambistas, organized into samba
schools, joined the citywide festival dominated by the
pre-existing mainstays of Carnival: the grandes
sociedades, or great societies, in which the city’s elite
paraded. Eventually, the elite parades died out, and samba
became the preferred dance of Brazilians and a growing
stream of international tourists who came to partake in the
pre-Lenten celebration for which Brazil is now famous.
Similar to Argentina’s tango, once samba enjoyed
worldwide acclaim, resistance among the Brazilian elite
dissipated and they embraced it as though it had been their
creation in the first place.
Sports
Out of the barrio developed another passion: soccer,
known as fútbol in Spanish and futebol in Portuguese.
Introduced by British sailors, and merchants alighting in
Buenos Aires in the 1870s, the sport was picked up by
dockworkers and other laborers and was soon the rage
among men and boys in the poor neighborhoods of port
cities such as Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Santos in
Brazil. As mentioned in Chapter 1, an Englishman named
Charles Miller (1874–1953) is thought to have introduced
298orga- nized soccer to Brazil. The son of Paulista
merchants, Miller organized a couple of teams made up of
young British employees of the São Paulo Gas Company,
the London and Brazilian Bank, and the São Paulo
Railway Company. They played their first game in 1895
and the sport remained a pastime in elite British clubs that
primarily hosted cricket matches. In Brazil and Argentina
soccer was also introduced as a diversion among British
managers and technicians in some textile plants, but
eventually spread to the work- ers, who struck up matches
with the owners, or each other, during breaks. Because of
the ease with which soccer can be played, requiring no
more than a level field or street, and one ball, the sport
spread through working-class neighborhoods in many
Latin American cities, becoming more of a passion for
young men (not women or girls, at least as participants) of
the lower class than it had been for the British elite who
intro- duced it. Working-class youths also grew to be far
superior players. Eventually, soccer was transformed from
a street sport to one played by organized clubs, facing off
in local, citywide, national, and international matches.
Historian Greg Bocketti has shown that in Argentina and
Brazil soccer teams and club competitions (in addition to
unions and cultural organizations) served as a conduit for
Italian immigrants to incorporate into the broader urban
society.
Recent scholarship has shown that local politicians, even
hierarchical caudillos, were unable to dictate policies to all
citizens. In Argentina crowds used civic festivals, church
feast days, sporting events, and localized celebrations to
exhibit allegiance to one political party or another. Local
leaders, and caudillos such as Juan Manual Rosas, not only
299participated in community festivals; they actively used the
events to garner political support. Citizens sported ribbons
and uniforms declaring their political sympathies and used
the opportunity of public events to wrest concessions or
pro- mises from leaders. Citizens in Mexico, Argentina,
Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, and other locales were able to
temper the most authoritarian regimes. In fact, no leader
was able to rule through repression alone, but had instead
to provide patronage appoint- ments and respond to the
demands of petitioners for pay and benefits from the state.
Urban Renewal
By the end of the nineteenth century, both old-line,
native-born elites and late- nineteenth-century middle-class
reformers were expressing concern over the more sordid
facets of urban growth: crowding, squalor, unhygienic
living and working conditions, disease, poverty, crime, and
vice. The urban elite of Buenos Aires blamed the victims
for the squalid conditions into which they were thrust,
including the outbreak of a yellow fever epidemic in 1871.
It was a pattern reminiscent of Yankee elites who
despaired at the sight of the Irish, southern and eastern
European masses pouring into Boston, New York, New
Orleans, and Philadelphia. Epidemics of yellow fever,
malaria, smallpox, and influenza periodically ravaged the
major cities of these rapidly expanding regions. Since
ships called at many ports on a single voyage, includ- ing
Recife, Rio, and Santos in Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay;
Buenos Aires, Argentina; Callao, Peru; and Valparaiso,
Chile, captains were loath to risk encountering a disease in
one port and carrying it to others, thus infecting personnel
over a wide swath of the continent. During epidemic
300seasons port officials refused entry to any ship whose last
stop was in a city recently known to have been in the
throes of an epidemic; some-times ship captains simply
refused to dock ships during the summer months in ports
known for their insalubrious conditions.
A combination of disease and the tenements and their poor
residents that filled down- town districts motivated city
and national governments to embark on urban renewal
projects that transformed many Latin American cities into
copies of European cultural refinement, while
simultaneously combating tropical diseases. One such
project in Buenos Aires eliminated yellow fever – along
with the poor inhabitants who had contracted it. As new
buildings replaced older, run-down structures, rising
property values in down- town districts forced
lower-income residents to move to distant suburbs or into
the already horrendously crowded tenements in the largely
Italian immigrant district of La Boca. Fortified by Social
Darwinist conceptions of northern European superiority
over those of so-called “uncivilized” (Mediterranean,
indigenous, and African) background, city leaders sought
to develop a division of urban space that segregated
residents by both race and class. A system of streetcar and
rail lines installed with British money and expertise
allowed workers to reach their places of employment.
Brazil’s capital city of Rio de Janeiro underwent a
renovation at much the same time. Rio was geographically
well situated to service ships passing from the Brazilian
northeast to Montevideo and Buenos Aires further south;
the harbor was wide, deep, and sheltered from the ocean
by a large bay and the city was then, as now, breath￾301takingly beautiful. Nevertheless, an obstacle in the path of
further development was the poor state of public health:
Rio de Janeiro, a tropical city whose residences,
government offices, commercial, financial, and cultural
institutions rested on narrow strips of land wedged
between sharply rising hills, the ocean, and the bay proved
to be especially unhealthy. The land flooded during the
rainy season, when water from the bay rose above
ineffective retaining walls and poured into the streets.
Because the drainage system was so inadequate,
neighborhoods remained marshy even after the rainwater
receded. Worse, for much of the year stagnant water stood
in pools through- out the city, providing an ideal breeding
ground for mosquitoes carrying yellow fever and malaria.
A British traveler described Rio in the late nineteenth
century as a “labyrinth of narrow streets, some not more
than seven yards wide. West and north of the busy and
squalid port area the city is built around marsh and
swamps. Here where the poorer inhabitants congregate, is
a happy hunting-ground for the yellow fever scourge.”2
In Cuba and Central America US military forces and
health officials had pioneered effective, if often ruthless,
vaccination and sanitation programs during the army
occupa- tion, with the intentional side effect of cleansing
areas to make them safe for trade and investment.
Following the Spanish-American War of 1898, Carlos
Finlay (1833- 1915), the chief scientific officer of
Havana’s Yellow Fever Commission, discovered the link
between stagnant water, mosquitoes, and epidemics.
Finlay’s discovery led to widespread sanitation campaigns
in Havana and other Cuban cities, under the auspices of
Walter Reed (1851–1902) and the US Army Corps of
302Engineers. In Central America William Gorgas
(1854–1920) copied the Havana program to clear the way
for construction of the Panama Canal. The campaign
against yellow fever involved destroying the breeding
grounds for the Aedes aegypti mosquito and its larvae and
draining all pools of stagnant water. In many countries of
Latin America, especially in crowded urban environments,
public health and pest control teams swept through densely
populated barrios, killing rats and using vaccines and
serums to stop the spread of plague, smallpox, and a host
of diseases that were by that time already rare in many
areas of the developed world.
In March 1903 Brazilian president Rodrigues Alves
(1848–1919) appointed Oswaldo Gonçalves Cruz
(1872–1917) director general of public health, and Cruz
began to address yellow fever. Along with the sanitation of
Havana and other tropical and semi-tropical cities,
including Hong Kong, Cape Town in South Africa, and
Kingston in Jamaica, the full-scale assault on yellow fever
in Rio de Janeiro stands as a landmark in the record book
of disease prevention and control. Dr. Cruz’s public health
crews, who earned the name “mosquito inspectors,” moved
throughout the city, spraying, killing rats, ordering the
demolition of all unsanitary housing, and systematically
imple- menting various aspects of the new code. Following
a plan similar to the one used in Buenos Aires, itself
patterned on Georges-Eugène Haussmann’s (1809–91)
famous renewal of Paris in the late nineteenth century,
Rio’s sanitation/renovation plan resulted in the relocation
of the city’s poor from city centers to distant suburbs and
company-style towns rimming the outskirts. In subsequent
years the poor took up residence in the favelas that soon
303began to dot the urban landscape of Rio and other
Brazilian cities. By 1905 downtown Rio de Janeiro had
electrical lighting, while most of the areas where the poor
and working class lived had yet to be connected even to
the existing system of gas illumination. Unfortunately the
pattern adopted in Rio de Janeiro was reproduced in many
cities of Latin America, where the mass of urban residents
enjoyed limited access to lighting, sanitation, clean water,
and health care or the beaches extolled in tourist literature.
Government inattention to food and housing shortages,
poor transportation service, and deplorable sanitary
conditions have provoked discontent, and rioting, in
working-class neighborhoods and the shantytowns of
many cities of Latin America throughout the twentieth
century and into the twenty-first.
Mexico and Benito Juárez
The history of Mexico in the nineteenth century differed
from that of other areas of Latin America in that it was not
affected by immigration and did not grapple with either
slavery or the struggle to abolish it. Instead, Mexico
confronted the effects of the disastrous war with the US:
mainly the need to rebuild a nation in the wake of the loss
of over a third of its territory. Thus the main issues of the
century – modernization, industrial- ization, inequality,
state versus Church and domestic versus foreign
domination – occurred against the backdrop of a deeply
fractured nation. Mexican sovereignty hinged on an ability
to unify and to construct a Mexican identity capable of
encompassing rural and urban areas, and indigenous,
European, and mestizo cultures. Although Mexico had,
and still has, a large Afro-descendant population along the
304Gulf coast, the main issue of national identity in the
nineteenth and most of the twentieth century rested with
integrating the indigenous society into one based on
European values. The two figures of the nineteenth century
who presided over this nation-building project were Benito
Juárez, from 1857 to 1872, and Porfirio Díaz, from 1876 to
1911.
Benito Juárez (1806–72) extended the secularization of
Mexico begun under a series of liberal governments after
the defeat of Santa Anna. Under Juárez, Mexico did away
with fueros, the privileged exemptions that allowed the
clergy and military to avoid civil and criminal prosecution;
ended church control of vast amounts of property; and
consolidated state power over taxation and the regulation
of births, marriages, deaths, cemeteries, adoptions, and
family matters.
A Zapotec Indian born in 1806 of humble, rural origins,
Juárez obtained an excellent education and law degree by
pure dint of his brilliance, hard work, and the recognition
of his exceptional mind and character from influential
members of the Church and secular world. He rose to the
governorship of the state of Oaxaca, gaining notice for his
participation in the Revolution of Ayutla in 1855 that
deposed Santa Anna and sent him into exile in Jamaica
(from which he never returned). As President of Mexico,
Juárez instituted reforms to break the stranglehold of
conservative landowners, fortified by their alliance with
the Catholic Church, who held the vast majority of
Mexican rural laborers, Indians, and the small urban
proletariat in poverty and ignorance. Although admired by
the poor, as well as by modernizing liberal elites, Juárez
305ran into trouble when he tried to privatize “corporate
property,” which by definition included the vast estates of
private latifundistas, extensive holdings of the Catholic
Church, and Indian communal lands, called ejidos.
According to laws laid down in Juárez’s “Reforma” and
the Constitution of 1857, ejidos fell into the category of
“corporate holdings,” even though they were lands
attached to Indian villages. Most were used for common
grazing, with individual parcels worked by members of the
community. Some liberals in the reform government
nonetheless considered it essential for the progress of
Mexico to divide all estates into small, single-family farms
– whether they had been guaranteed for the use of the
indigenous people since the days of the Conquest, or were
in the hands of church and corporate landowners. The
strategy failed, serving only to alienate Juárez from the
indigenous peasantry, a constituency from which he should
have received support. Ironically, the first Indian president
of Mexico passed a law that contravened the ancient
customs of its indigenous people.
French Invasions
Plagued by war, near constant Conservative revolts, and
political intrigues, Juárez was deposed in 1864 when
French Emperor Napoleon III (1808–73), at the invitation
of Mexican Conservatives, crowned Austrian Archduke
Ferdinand Maximilian von Hapsburg (1832–67) as head of
state. In 1862, in an attempt to rekindle its empire, France
launched an invasion of Mexico. Their attempt to take the
city of Puebla, a short distance from the capital at Mexico
City, was repelled by General Ignacio Zaragoza on May 5.
306The victory was particularly sweet, since the Mexican
force was made up of conscripts with little training, while
the French had a professional army that outnumbered the
Mexicans three to one. Two years later the French were
successful, but the heroes of May 5, 1862 are remembered,
particularly in Puebla, for their valor. (Although only a
local holiday in Mexico, “Cinco de Mayo” has become
very popular in the United States, where many
non-Mexicans erroneously think it is Mexico’s
independence day.)
The misguided, and certainly misinformed, Maximilian,
along with his disoriented wife, Charlotte of Belgium
known as Carlota (1840–1927), arrived in Mexico and,
much to the surprise of his backers, embarked on a plan of
noblesse oblige to elevate Mexico’s standard of living. In
his short time at the helm, Maximilian introduced modern,
liberal reforms including a free press, freedom for political
prisoners, living wages, and other measures his
conservative and church backers had no intention of
supporting. Isolated from much of the Mexican populace,
who saw the French monarch as yet another European
interloper in league with the conservative elite, Maximilian
eventually lost the support of the Church and conservatives
as well, because he failed to pander to the latter’s interests.
Under pressure from the US, the French withdrew the
regiments they had dispatched to prop him up, allowing
Juárez to reclaim the presidency. Once back in office,
Juárez showed no mercy toward the confused old man and
ordered Maximilian’s execution.
The short-lived reform era ended abruptly when the
president who succeeded Juárez, Lerdo de Tejada, was
307overthrown in 1876. Benito Juárez’s legacy was as a leader
who attempted to steer Mexico onto a modern path, limit
the domination of the Catholic Church in most civil
matters, and push ahead with reforms such as public
education and distribution of land to the peasantry, all of
which served to anger the landed elite and the Church.
Porfirio Díaz (1830–1915) was the man responsible for
Lerdo’s overthrow and the politician who would dominate
Mexican politics for the next 30 years.
The Rise of Porfirio Díaz
Porfirio Díaz rose to political prominence as a hero in the
war against the French occupation and a defender of the
rule of law in the face of extra-legal maneuverings
identified with Juárez and his successors, as the Reforma
deteriorated. Ultimately, however, Díaz proved to be more
autocratic than the forces he initially had opposed. During
his first term in office, beginning May 5, 1877 and
scheduled to end in 1881, Díaz enacted a number of
progressive reforms, including laws ensuring greater
com-petition for political office and competitive bids from
foreign companies seeking to invest in Mexican oil,
mining, and industrial enterprises. He left office as
promised, but after a short stint as governor of his home
state of Oaxaca, re-entered national politics as a very
different leader. The new Díaz outlawed all opposition and
ruled through force until overthrown after the 1910
election. From the 1890s onward he wasted no time
overturning the reforms and rescinding the progressive
measures enacted as part of the 1857 Constitution. In fact,
one of the rallying cries of the 1910 rebellion – when a
broad coalition of urban and rural poor workers, domestic
308landowners and entrepreneurs, intellectuals and democrats
joined together to oust Díaz – was a call to return to the
1857 Constitution. Porfirio Díaz’s tenure in office is often
remembered as a period that transformed Mexico into one
of the safest countries in the world for business, foreign
capital, and the wealthy; but among the least safe for
Mexico’s masses, especially the rural poor and Indians.
Díaz’s transition from heroic defender of the fatherland to
autocrat can be traced through the biographical
background of Emiliano Zapata, the legendary hero of the
revolutionary forces that deposed the man then known as
“the old dictator” at the out- break of the revolutionary
war. José Zapata, young Emiliano’s great-uncle and the
revered village elder in the hamlet of Anenecuilco, had
fought with Porfirio Díaz in the 1866–7 war against the
French invaders, founded one of the first “Porfirista” clubs
in the village, and until his death in 1876 the older Zapata
had turned out the vote for Díaz, even when the latter
betrayed the will of the common folk. Indicative of both
Díaz’s reputation and the esteem a village elder
commanded, many poor peasants remained loyal to Díaz
purely on the basis of his early heroism. By 1910,
however, disaffection among the ranks of a new generation
of peasant leaders was widespread, and what- ever status
Díaz had achieved through his earlier exploits could no
longer excuse the tyranny he imposed on the nation. The
full details of the Mexican Revolution are taken up in
Chapter 7.
Intellectual Theories: Positivism and Eugenics
309Porfirio Díaz relied extensively on a group of scientific
and technocratic advisors who were imbued with Positivist
thinking. Mexico was not alone in advocating such
theories. They were based on the philosophical Positivism
popular in Europe and America at the time, especially
Auguste Comte (1798–1857) in France and Herbert
Spencer (1820–1903) in England. As a school of
philosophy, Positivism became quite popular in Latin
American scholarly circles because it provided a technical,
seemingly achievable, path to modernization. If all
progress in society was, as the Positivists argued, acquired
through science, as opposed to resulting from an act of
God or divine inter- vention, then societies mired in
poverty, inefficiency, and primitive tools and technology
could be improved. The poor peasant, digging in the
ground with a stick, eating a diet lacking in proper
nutrients, bearing children year after year only to have
many of them die from the combined effects of poverty
and disease, could be reformed through technology. He or
she could be taught modern agricultural techniques,
introduced to a better diet, modern tools, private property,
and even the basics of family planning. Some of the
leading Positivists were advocates of secular education,
mandatory vaccina- tion, and government programs to
promote efficiency in farming, manufacturing, urban
planning, and government programs to advance progress.
Positivists tended to support a strong state that governed
with technocratic efficiency, a strictly rationalized tax
system, a business environment that invited foreign
investment, individual owner- ship of land and resources,
and a judiciary that served for life as a way of eliminating
corruption.
310While some Positivists and científicos in Mexico favored
science over superstition as the best tool for solving
society’s problems, their theories and the ways they were
implemented fell short. First, Positivists looked at a static
world rather than one in which social class, race, and
gender were socially constructed. Indians, for example,
were not poor because they failed to fit into the European
notion of scientific behavior, but because society at that
time placed little value on communal ownership of
property, for example. That is, Positivists failed to see that
their own prejudices and consciousnesses deter- mined the
values they favored for any society. Secondly, not only did
Positivists fail to challenge their own assumptions; they
believed science was a cure-all for society’s wrongs. While
it is true that education, proper health care, and other
benefits play a positive role, the Positivists felt that these
techniques alone would resolve all of society’s problems.
They did not believe that a society could function well in a
variety of ways, quite different from their own. They
rejected the beliefs and culture of indigenous people,
seeing them as backward and antithetical to civilized
society. They rarely accepted religion as the glue that held
some communities together regardless of its rational or
irrational character, although they correctly branded the
Church as a bastion of conservatism.
While not all Positivists were consciously racist, any more
than many other intellectuals of the time, Positivism
promoted a concept that the world of plants and animals,
human development and evolution, was in some part
deterministic. The cientificos were dismayed that the
Indian resided on the bottom rung of society’s ladder by
virtue of his or her incompletely evolved status, but could
311only uplift indigenous people by forcing them to abandon
everything that made them different from the European.
Mexico’s científicos were only one wave of an ideological
current that intellectuals in Latin America, and much of the
world for that matter, embraced in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. Other intellectuals pointed to
Charles Darwin’s (1809–82) statement in the Descent of
Man as evidence for their philosophy: “... at some future
period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the
civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate,
and replace, the savage races throughout the
world.”3Despite this statement, Darwin is not thought to
have championed such a theory; rather, the concept of
racial determinism was promoted through eugenics
societies throughout the world. Its proponents argued that
white, northern Europeans were at the pinnacle of the
human pyramid – the fittest – while the black African and
the American Indian were at the bottom – the least fit – an
argument reminiscent of colonial times. At various stages
in between were Asians, Jews, Mediterranean and Slavic
people, the Irish, and others whose inclusion on the list
varied depending on who was doing the defining.
Nancy Stepan’s work on the eugenics movement in Latin
America shows that there was both a fatalistic side to
eugenics (people who are poor and non-European are des￾tined to be scientifically weeded out in the evolutionary
process) and an optimistic side (humans can take control of
their destiny and, through science, raise the level of the
outcast and incorporate him or her into civilization). This
debate that pitted theory against practice in the project of
“uplifting and civilizing,” as the intellectuals, medical
312personnel, and politicians saw it, played out in a variety of
ways. In Brazil, for example, during a hotly debated
campaign to require mandatory vaccination against
smallpox in 1904, some Positivists advocated the
implementation of forced vaccination and public health
programs because they epitomized the use of science to
eliminate disease; while other Positivists eschewed
vaccination because it interfered with the natural selection
process by allowing the poor and “racially inferior” to
survive.
Beginning at the turn of the century, Bolivian public health
officials and medical experts embarked on a series of
projects designed to curb disastrous health problems
ranging from yaws and dysentery to yellow fever, typhoid,
smallpox, pneumonia, whooping cough, and a host of
others. Historian Ann Zulawski explains the limits of
health policies in the hands of experts – be they scientists
from the Rockefeller Foundation or local Bolivian doctors
– who held indigenous people, women, and the poor in low
regard. Bolivia, as Zulawski shows, is an excellent
example of the way an underlying disdain for the patient,
based on racist and sexist assumptions, interferes with the
delivery of health care and limits the effectiveness of
programs designed to pull the nation forward. Although
prac- ticing scientists, Bolivian health professionals
insisted on linking disease to race and ethnicity, thereby
consciously or unconsciously assuming that Indians, who
make up half of Bolivia’s population, were unable,
unprepared, or simply unwilling to embrace a program of
personal hygiene. All the evidence, however, was to the
contrary. In those cases, admittedly rare, when doctors
took an interest in indigenous medicine and attempted to
313understand the logic of indigenous thinking regarding
health, or when they recruited indigenous health care
practitioners to government medical teams beginning in
the 1930s, they were more successful.
After the Nazi experiments of World War II, where the
racist expression of eugenics theories was fully
incorporated into a national policy, resulting in the
extermination of six million Jews, along with the disabled,
homosexuals, gypsies, and any others deemed unfit for the
“Master Race,” eugenics lost its appeal, and notions of
race-based superiority became increasingly discredited.
Thus, to view the científicos as a particularly Mexican
phenomenon would be a mistake. They were a high-profile
manifestation of Positivist philosophy in action, wedded to
a particular government administration. In part the
cientificos could lament the state of the impoverished
Mexican castas by attributing their demise to their own
inability to adapt to the ways of science and the rationales
of the white leadership.
Conclusion
The nineteenth century was as much about creating the
Latin American identity as about striving for political and
economic sovereignty. In the last chapter we examined the
search for economic viability through trade and export
markets. This chapter looked at the other side of the
equation: the arrival in Latin America of millions of immi￾grants to provide the backbone of the workforce.
Immigrants from Europe and Asia brought with them new
traditions, languages, religions, and pastimes, changing
forever the cultural landscape of both rural and urban
314countries. While most immigrants settled in the Southern
Cone nations, especially Argentina, Uruguay, and southern
Brazil, nearly every nation of the Americas welcomed at
least some migrants from Europe and Asia.
Mexico’s search for social cohesion occurred against the
backdrop of seeking reconciliation between the traditions
of indigenous communities that had lived and survived in
ways starkly at odds with European traditions. The task of
the nineteenth-century political leaders was to find a way
to reconcile communal values with the modernizing
reforms of the capitalist world. That it fell to Mexico’s
only indigenous president, Benito Juárez, to attempt a land
reform that would curb the power of the corporatist Church
and the large landowners, but ultimately disrupt the
indigenous way of life, was both ironic and ultimately
tragic. Mexico’s attempt to forge a unified nation came
more as a result of Porfirio Díaz’s authoritarian rule than
Juárez’s comprehensive land reform.
Philosophers sought to break with the static superstitious
dogma of Catholicism which had served as the guiding
principles since the colonial period. In keeping with the
modernizing and scientific ethos of the time, various
combinations of Positivism, Social Darwinism, and
adherence to eugenics were debated in both government
and intellectual circles. The mottos and flags adopted by
the new nations reflected the vision that order and progress
were the watchwords of modernization, as was the urban
renewal and “civilization” of urban areas. However, it was
never a progress that could encompass everyone, leaving
in place, or even exacerbating, racial, class, and gender
divisions.

Revolution from Countryside to City: Mexico
If cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Lima,
Montevideo, and Mexico City were undergoing major
transformations, life in the countryside in Latin America
largely remained mired in traditional class relationships.
As a result, predominantly rural Mexico entered into one
of the most intense periods of economic and political
struggle of any Latin American country. The conflict
engulfed the agrarian sector, where longstanding
inequalities were deeply resented by the majority of the
rural population but reached urban areas as well.
At the beginning of his classic study of Emiliano Zapata
(1879–1919) and the Mexican Revolution, John Womack
wrote: “This is a book about country people who did not
want to move and therefore got into a revolution.”1 The
revolution was rooted in the issue of land rights, and one
of its primary causes was the objection of the peasantry to
their forced removal from the lands they had worked and
struggled to retain since colonial times. But it was about
other things as well. Many authors who have written since
Womack’s book appeared in the late 1960s have detailed
the various grievances fueling this conflict that convulsed
Mexico from 1910 to 1920 and probed the motives of the
various social forces, and ethnic, gender, and racial groups
that participated. The conflict was indeed so widespread
and the issues it addressed so vast that one might argue
that most cultural, economic, and political issues at stake
in Latin America were in some way and at some time
addressed in the course of the Mexican Revolution.
316Womack vividly describes the rural people of the small
state of Morelos, in southern Mexico, who took up the
revolutionary cause in order to defend, or restore, the titles
to their lands and homes, titles many of them had guarded
for generations. However, under Zapata’s leadership the
peasants of Morelos first joined the Revolution in 1910
over an issue far removed from their immediate concerns:
an irregularity in the process of presidential succession.
But resolving the immediate political issue – preventing
Porfírio Díaz from once again stealing an election – did
nothing in the long term to address the peasantry’s
underlying problem.
Events in Mexico came together to produce the first
modern social revolution of the twentieth century. It began
as a political dispute in 1910, but gradually evolved into a
demand for a deeper social transformation, and eventually
culminated in the writing of a new Constitution in 1917.
Interspersed throughout the entire period of upheaval was
a cultural transformation that altered most facets of
Mexican society, from the superficial to the fundamental.
Few people – male, female, adult, child, white or casta,
Indian or black – from any social class were left untouched
by the events of these tumultuous decades.
The Porfiriato
At the start of the twentieth century Mexico was an
agrarian country. Issues of landownership and struggles
over land reform were central to Mexico’s political
formation. In 1900 over 77 percent of the population lived
in the countryside, and the man who ruled over that land
was General Porfírio Díaz. Although he had come to
317power vowing to side with the people (the pueblo, in
Spanish), this promise proved to be nothing more than a
transparent ploy to appease the expectations of those who
had placed great hope in the reforms of Benito Juárez and
thought that Díaz would make good on those promises.
Instead, during the 34 years he stood at the helm of a
compliant Mexican state, either directly or through a
surrogate who ruled at his behest, Díaz exerted such
overwhelming political, economic, and cultural dominance
that the era itself bears his name: the Porfiriato.
Díaz claimed to be modernizing Mexico and in many ways
he did, but most of the changes he enacted benefited
primarily his close supporters and foreign investors. He
was known to have cultivated an elaborate patronage
system through which he doled out favors. Nonetheless,
the technological innovations undertaken during the
Porfiriato were impressive: a tenfold increase in railways,
steam-powered locomotives, a railroad from Veracruz to
Mexico City, telegraph lines across the country,
steampowered factories in Mexico City and other
industrial centers. These improvements were mostly
financed by foreign capital; Díaz showed less concern for
the exploitative conditions Mexican workers endured in
foreign-owned companies. Ruling through a policy known
as pan y palo, which in English we call “carrot and stick,”
Díaz was a master of cooptation and coercion, backed up
by repression. He appointed state governors and gave them
free rein to rule over the local population and enrich
themselves, so long as they did not interfere with his own
authority.
318Díaz’s technological and scientific modernization policies
accompanied, rather than opposed, as might seem logical,
a land policy that consolidated large estates in fewer and
fewer hands. Through a series of laws passed from 1883 to
1894, the way was opened for a few individuals to win
control over a large amount of land that had been declared
“vacant.” Although frequently inhabited, occupants’ proof
of ownership or tenancy (such as a title or agreement) was
ruled invalid in courts. In other cases powerful lawyers
working for landowners were able to wrest the land from
its rightful occupants by enmeshing disputes in prolonged
court battles. Finally, on those occasions when powerful
interests were unable to win in court, they called in the
rurales, Díaz’s appointed rural militia, to clear the land,
thereby compelling dispossessed peasants to embark on an
uphill, and generally futile, attempt to win back their land
through the courts or petitions to state authorities. Often
illiterate, unable to hire a lawyer, and unused to the
complicated bureaucracy of local and regional courts, the
country people stood little chance of emerging victorious,
no matter how legitimate their claim. One of Díaz’s friends
obtained 12 million acres in Baja California for nothing
more than a bribe to local judges, who simply declared the
land to be vacant. In some cases, when occupants resisted
they were killed or captured and sold to plantations in
Cuba and the Yucatán as slaves. Alternatively, powerful
landowners and political bosses diverted, or cut off
entirely, the water supply to villages, thereby forcing the
rightful owners to crowd in with relatives or move to other
communities where water was still available; relinquish
title to the land and sell themselves into debt peonage,
even slavery; or to give up and move to the fast-growing
cities. By 1900 over 90 percent of the communal land of
319the Central Plateau had been sold off or expropriated,
forcing an estimated 9.5 million peasants off the land and
into peonage at the service of the big landowners.
The cultivation of exportable commodities such as coffee,
tobacco, henequen (for making rope), and sugar
predominated on the estates, leaving almost no land for the
production of basic foodstuffs, such as corn and wheat, or
livestock. Most of the time the new owners either used the
land inefficiently or left it to lie fallow as a means to drive
up the price of the maize or cotton crops they were
cultivating on other estates. When not engaged in
speculation themselves, Mexican latifundistas found a
ready market for land among US speculators. As a result of
the overwhelming emphasis on export-oriented agriculture
and concomitant inattention to meeting subsistence needs
at home, hunger gripped the countryside at unprecedented
levels. Meanwhile, the refining of pulque (a strong
alcoholic drink made from the maguey cactus plant) and
other cheap alcoholic beverages increased. In the midst of
hunger the number of bars in Mexico City rose from 51 in
1864 to 1,400 in 1900, and the rate of death from
alcoholism and alcohol-related accidents outstripped that
of most other areas of the world.
By 1911 US companies had controlling interests in
Mexico’s copper, gold, lead, and tin mining, monopolizing
not only above-ground refining and processing works, but
subsoil rights as well. Mexico’s oil industry, which was by
the end of the first decade of the new century the third
largest in the world, was sold to the North American
Rockefeller consortium. Profits in all industries were very
high while, regardless of whether the enterprise was
320foreign-owned or domestic, wages and working conditions
were terrible. Men and women left the land to take up
urban jobs as factory laborers, where women earned a
fraction of the salary paid to men. The typical workday
was 12–15 hours long; men were paid 75 cents, women
and children as little as 11 cents, for a day’s labor. Many
were never paid in cash, instead receiving vouchers that
could only be redeemed at the company store for food or
housing in the company towns that encircled plants and
mines. The large number of women and girls who entered
the workforce in the later years of the century took up
typically female jobs as maids, cooks, nannies,
laundresses, street vendors, and prostitutes. For some jobs,
such as rolling cigars and the least-skilled work in textile
mills, owners hired more women and children than men, in
hopes that their level of desperation would make them less
likely to unionize and cause trouble. Regardless of gender
or age, the vast majority of workers were unable to resist
the horrendous working and living conditions they faced.
Whether in the countryside, recent arrivals to the city, or
longtime urban dwellers, Mexico’s poor lived out their
lives in miserable conditions, forced into debt from a
young age and confined to a state of perpetual dependency
on the factory bosses, landowners, and mine operators.
Opposition to the Porfiriato
Not surprisingly, by the early 1900s the Porfiriato was
confronting a chorus of opposition from a range of
political tendencies. From within the ranks of the Mexican
Liberal Party (PLM), organized by Ricardo Flores Magón
(1873–1922), came persistent calls for a return to the
electoral process, for the judiciary to serve the interests of
321society, including members of the elite and middle class
who were not firmly within Díaz’s grasp; and for the
extension of rights to workers in rural and urban areas.
Mexican landowners who had rejected, or were never
offered, the favors the dictator bestowed on his closest
cronies began to voice audibly their opposition. In
addition, Díaz’s pattern of increasingly favoring US
investors, mining companies, and industrialists rankled
sectors of the Mexican bourgeoisie who wanted to
maintain a better balance between national and foreign
capital investment, or who thought playing off US
investors against British and other European capitalists
was a more prudent way for Mexico to maintain control of
its natural resources. A growing proportion of the
urban-based, liberal elite found Díaz’s old-style corruption
embarrassing and injurious to Mexico’s image and
standing as an independent nation, and thus sought his
defeat in the electoral arena.
Finally, more and more unrest began to surface among
rural laborers, landless indigenous peasants, and labor
unions. Discontent among peasants and workers, as
historian John Tutino has pointed out, was nothing new,
since the poor had repeatedly protested against the Church,
landowners, industrialists and the governments they
controlled for over a century, from 1810 until 1910.
Likewise, the poor had generally gone down in defeat,
since the elite remained steadfastly “united in defense of
privilege and profit to crush the insurrection of the
independence era – and to prevent a movement toward
social reconstruction.”2 Under Porfírio Díaz rapid
development and unbridled foreign investment, combined
with corruption at every level of state and local
322government, provoked discontent with the prevailing
order.
Initially, the most dramatic signs of opposition to Díaz’s
brand of politics came from organized labor in the form of
two key strikes. When workers in the Cananea Copper
Company in the northern state of Sonora went out on strike
in 1906, they were lobbing the opening salvo in a
revolution that would disrupt all of Mexico for years to
come. In the tense atmosphere of the early twentieth
century, the conflict at Cananea represented more than the
articulation of workers’ grievances and management’s
responses at one workplace. Founded in 1896 by William
Greene, a US entrepreneur who obtained concessions from
the Díaz government, the copper company’s history
epitomized Porfírio Díaz’s sellout of Mexico’s resources to
foreign interests. The concession enabled Greene not only
to build up the Cananea copper mine into one of the most
important mining operations in Mexico, but also to add
control over land and cattle, transportation networks,
lumber mills and a wide range of services, giving him
absolute dominance over a vast stretch of Mexican land, as
well as over the laborers who worked in his various
enterprises.
Beginning on June 1, 1906, 5,400 Mexican miners struck
along with a core of anarcho-syndicalist workers from the
United States who labored in the mines as well. The
company brought across the border from Arizona a band of
hired vigilantes to reinforce the Mexican federal army,
which was already actively repressing the strike by beating
up and dispersing workers. The strike’s bloody, violent
conclusion, along with the presence of US mercenaries on
323Mexican soil employed as the private military force of a
US company to beat, and even kill, Mexican workers,
stirred up anger toward the government that condoned
these practices. Similar sentiments arose during a second
labor dispute, this time at the French-owned Rio Blanco
textile factory in Orizaba, Veracruz. There a strike for
better wages and working conditions grew into a factory
occupation and eventual takeover of the town by several
thousand angry workers. Supported by Flores Magón’s
PLM in both cases, the worker uprisings served to
consolidate a powerful opposition to the policies of the
Díaz government and its foreign allies.
Constitutional Opposition
In 1909 the PLM and other opposition forces coalesced
around the candidacy of Francisco Madero (1873–1913) to
run against Díaz for the presidency. Madero, a prosperous
landowner and banker from the northern state of Coahuila,
ran on a platform calling for the end to Díaz’s practice of
succeeding himself as president, a return to civil
government as called for by the Constitution, and a
program of moderate concessions to peasants and workers
– which he considered essential to stop the spread of
anarchist ideas. Gathering support from all regions, and
from every social and economic stratum of the country,
Madero appeared to be sweeping into office when Díaz
interrupted the process and tried to place his adversary
under virtual house arrest. Madero escaped and fled across
the border to San Antonio, Texas, where he began to raise
an army of followers to ensure his victory, even at the risk
of armed combat against President Díaz and his supporters.
From Texas Madero announced the Plan of San Luis
324Potosí, named himself as provisional president, and, with
the tacit support of the US government (which had
suddenly had a change of heart toward Díaz when he opted
to favor British over American investors on a new
enterprise), unleashed a military campaign.
From various parts of the country Madero began to draw
supporters, who came to be known as the
“Constitutionalists”. Among them were Pascual Orozco, a
muleteer from Chihuahua (who would abandon Madero a
couple years later), Francisco “Pancho” Villa
(1878–1923), an erstwhile social bandit turned
revolutionary with a strong following among landless
peasants in the north, and Emiliano Zapata, a
well-respected leader of indigenous and mestizo farmers in
Morelos, a state to the south of the capital. By the spring of
1911 the Constitutionalists had gained a considerable
following, although many poor, illiterate, and destitute
recruits had only a cursory understanding of the conflict
ahead. Villa, an adept military commander and astute
political organizer, captured many of the northern towns,
including Ciudad Juárez across from El Paso, Texas,
where the wily commander and arms trader was able to
buy weapons to supply his growing army.
In the south, Zapata’s army swelled with insurgents who
for years had been fighting against the sugar hacendados
who had been usurping land belonging to ancient Indian
villages. Zapata, who was not known for making rash
decisions, weighed carefully the pros and cons of joining
forces with Madero and Villa, personalities quite different
from each other and unlike his own. Eventually Zapata
opted to support Madero because he agreed with the land
325reform provisions of the latter’s platform, as laid out in the
Plan de San Luis Potosí. For many who took up weapons
and swelled Zapata’s army the choice was less intellectual.
Anthropologist Oscar Lewis interviewed Pedro and
Esperanza Martínez, young peasants from a village in
Morelos, about Pedro’s decision to join the Zapatista army.
According to Esperanza, her husband joined “because they
offered to give him food . . . he said at least he would have
something to eat and furthermore they would pay him.”
Initially resistant to the prospect of her husband
abandoning her and their children to join a distant fight,
Esperanza eventually warmed to the idea because “he
promised to send me money.”3 The lofty goals of the
revolutionary struggle drew sustenance from a rural
peasantry placed in dire straits by the policies of the
Porfiriato.
Fearing the support the rebel armies were amassing, as
well as the possibility of fullscale revolt from the working
class, Díaz made a deal with Madero in the spring of 1911,
after which Madero won the election and assumed office
as president in November. Once in office Madero proved
disappointing, showing little concern for the long-held
grievances against factory owners and large-scale
landholders that had won him the support of the workers
and peasants in the first place. Madero followed a
disastrous course of action; much the opposite from the
one Porfirio Díaz had pursued. Whereas the latter ran his
entire administration by granting favors to his friends and
supporters, Madero seemed to forget his supporters
entirely once he was in office. Whatever the Plan of San
Luis Potosí had promised to rural laborers, it was quickly
forgotten. Under pressure Madero introduced a program
326that allowed peasants to purchase some land, while
simultaneously opposing any reform that would alienate
the hacendados. The result was massive disaffection, and
ultimately rebellion, by those who had previously
supported him.
Under the leadership of Pascual Orozco (1882–1915) in
the northern states of Sonora and Chihuahua, Emiliano
Zapata in the south, and Pancho Villa in Chihuahua,
peasants began to occupy the lands and carry out their own
agrarian reform. Although the majority of estates were
Mexican-owned, hundreds of thousands of acres belonged
to US citizens, a fact that brought the US government and
army into the precarious balance of forces. Late in 1911
Zapata announced the “Plan of Ayala,” which stated that
the restoration of land usurped during the Porfiriato was
the most immediate goal of the revolution, along with the
establishment of rural cooperatives and measures to ensure
that the land stayed in the hands of its rightful owners. It is
fair to say that Zapata was furious with Madero for
reneging on land distribution and willing to throw in with
Orozco, and eventually Villa, to fulfill the program
articulated in his Plan de Ayala. At the other end of the
political spectrum, the hacendados and industrialists were
outraged at even the very few reforms Madero proposed,
such as granting workers the right to strike and the
peasantry the right to take their grievances to new courts
where redress would supposedly be more balanced.
Madero Assassinated
Madero thus faced opposition on two fronts and found
himself politically and, more importantly, militarily
327powerless. By the late fall and winter of 1912 Madero’s
government was in crisis. Fearful of alienating the
conservative landowners and industrialists, Madero failed
to side with the workers who had taken to the streets to
demand higher wages and the right to organize, nor did he
try to meet even the most reasonable calls by peasants to
return usurped land to its rightful owners.
In one of the bolder instances in the long and tawdry
history of US intervention in Mexico’s internal affairs,
American Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson (1859–1932)
summoned Madero’s military commander, General
Victoriano Huerta (1850–1916), to the US embassy where
they hammered out an agreement between Huerta and
Félix Díaz (1868–1945), Porfirio’s nephew and
Washington’s favored contender for the Mexican
presidency. Under the thinly veiled guise of “protecting
American interests,” the ambassador signaled the US
intention to recognize a new government that would
replace Madero. Although Wilson and his superiors in
Washington intended that Félix Díaz and his supporter
Bernardo Reyes actually take office, General Huerta
engineered his own rise to power and the subsequent
assassinations of President Madero, VicePresident José
Pino Suárez (1869–1913), and other government officials.
Firmly in office and enjoying the support of Mexico’s
powerful northern neighbor, President Huerta set about
restoring order to the countryside, his only hope for
holding onto power. Orozco’s disaffection with Madero
pushed him into Huerta’s camp, leading to his ultimate
political demise, but the brutal murder of the elected
president and unabashed manipulation by the US
328ambassador only served to galvanize nationalist forces
against the new dictator. United opposition by
Constitutionalists – comprised of the armies of Villa,
Zapata, and new additions Venustiano Carranza
(1859–1920), governor of the northern state of Coahuila,
and Álfaro Obregón (1880–1928) of Sonora – resulted in a
shaky alliance that, over the next few years, would
determine the course of the revolutionary struggle.
US Intervention
With the situation in Mexico growing increasingly
unstable, US owners of mines, land, and timber
companies, along with others holding substantial
investments in Mexico, began to have reservations about
Huerta’s ability to restore order. General Villa, commander
of one of the largest armies and one bordering on Texas,
enjoyed the loyalty of many Texas businessmen who
profited from supplying his army and its large retinue of
camp followers. Because revenues from US investments
and friendly relations with arms dealers along the border
were essential to the maintenance of Villa’s army, the
general provided protection to Americans in Mexico and
ensured that their property was safe. Nonetheless, powerful
industrialists in New York, and their allies in Washington,
were apprehensive about the nation’s instability and sought
to restore a safe investment environment, while politicians
were alarmed about insecurity along the border. On April
21, 1914, the US Navy attacked Veracruz with the
intention of influencing the course of the Revolution.
Washington assumed it would be able to gain the upper
hand by destabilizing Huerta and choosing the next
president from among the existing cadre of leaders –
329thereby eliminating, or diminishing, the influence of Villa
and Zapata from the outset. As with other such
interventions in Latin America (and elsewhere) the US
misjudged popular reaction in Mexico to its 1914 invasion.
Washington’s military action served more to unite Mexico
than divide it, forcing the US to take more extreme
measures in its quest to secure a compliant government on
its southern border. By year’s end the US had thrown its
support behind Carranza, who, as a member of the landed
gentry with close political ties to the industrial elite,
seemed a far more attractive ally than either Villa or
Zapata, both of whom represented the interests of the poor
and working class. Over the next few years the
revolutionary forces sparred across the expanse of
Mexican territory.
Ultimately, despite their political affinity, Villa and Zapata
were unable to forge a sustained united front to promote
their more progressive program. The conservative wing of
the Constitutionalists maneuvered to contain the demands
of the urban working class, peasantry, miners, small
businessmen, and farmers. Especially in the south, in the
Federal District of Mexico City, and in states bordering on
the capital, labor organizers were calling for new rights for
the working class. Centralized in the Casa del Obrero
Mundial, (House of the World Workers), a federation of
over 100,000 members of industrial and service unions,
radical workers were joining their demands with the
mobilized peasantry. The Casa was headquartered in the
House of Tiles and the Palace of Fine Arts along the
Alameda in downtown Mexico City, where meetings and
strategy sessions took place around the clock, coordinating
the growing strike waves of 1915 and 1916. By early 1916
330striking workers had shut down petroleum works, textile
companies, construction sites, and several mines,
demanding better wages, more worker control of the
production process, union recognition, enforced safety
standards, and other benefits.
Women in Combat
The core of an army – whether of revolutionaries trying to
overthrow a government or the military in defense of a
state – has traditionally been male. Mexico was no
exception. But during the Revolution, women traveled
with the armies as cooks, gunrunners, nurses, laundresses,
prostitutes, spies and much more, as is frequently the case
during insurgencies. They also served as soldiers who
fought on the front lines (Figure 7.1).
Some were soldaderas, a term that means “the one who
takes the soldier’s pay” (soldada) and uses it to buy
supplies for him. While the men rode horseback, the
women usually walked, carrying weapons, food, supplies,
cooking utensils, pots and pans, medicines, and children.
Because they walked, the soldaderas arrived at camps after
the men, but set to work immediately preparing the food,
nursing the sick, and caring for the young. According to
Elizabeth Salas, the ranks of soldaderas included women
from a male soldier’s family, but also others who joined
with the troops as a way of getting food for themselves and
their children, and earning some money, especially in areas
where the fighting had disrupted farming and the absence
of men had placed women in precarious circumstances.
Other women joined to provide logistical support, as well
as to fight as soldiers because they believed in the
331revolutionary cause. In essence, soldaderas joined the
armies for the same reasons as male soldiers: to get food,
earn money, and support the cause.
One regiment of the Mexican army in 1914 listed 3,559
officers and soldiers, 1,256 soldaderas, and 554 children.
In the post-revolution era, women were barred from
accompanying troops, serving as soldiers, or providing
logistical support, and the history of their contribution to
the Revolution was rewritten. The official story was that
soldaderas in the military camps were the wives of
soldiers, not combatants; or, conversely, women who
insisted on tagging along, usually referred to as camp
followers, or were there as prostitutes. The term “camp
follower,” in fact, came to mean prostitute, even though
many camp followers were not. Finally, in Mexico, as
elsewhere in times of war, women who were forced into
prostitution to escape poverty were considered entirely
disreputable, while the men who used the prostitutes, or
even raped in the course of fighting, were not. Only very
recently have governments and international agencies
passed laws stating that the use of sex slaves and the
practice of rape in the course of war must be considered a
violation of human rights.
Carranza as President
When Venustiano Carranza assumed the presidency in
1917 his goals were to pacify and repress the revolutionary
ardor burning in the labor movement and sever the
growing linkages between the industrial working class and
rural peons. For Carranza (see Box 7.1) and other
Constitutionalist landowners and industrialists, the
332essential work of the Revolution was over. Porfírio Díaz
and his crowd of military men were out of power; the US
could now be appeased, a moderate land reform initiated,
the Church brought under the control of the state, and labor
conditions improved. Whatever Carranza may have desired
in terms of meeting the demands of the Casa del Obrero
Mundial – decent wages, an end to mandatory conscription
of workers for mines and estates, company stores, and the
near-slave labor conditions owners imposed on the poor –
he never followed through. Such measures would have
upset the economic elite. The weak federal government
met the massive general strike in May 1916 with promises
to end unfair working conditions and curb the worst abuses
in the system, such as the practice of paying wages in
near-worthless script. The Casa negotiated an agreement,
sent its 90,000 members in the city back to work, and then
watched as management reneged on every single demand.
In response to further labor militancy, Carranza called in
the army, ultimately dispersing the workers in the city
through jailings, beatings, even death – the same tactics he
had used to defeat leaders in rural areas.

333Box 7.1 Revolutionaries in profile
334Three of the most important figures of the Mexican
Revolution – Emiliano Zapata, Francisco “Pancho”
Villa (see Figure 7.2), and Venustiano Carranza –
represent diverse and interesting personalities, each
different from the others in demeanor and in the
principles they brought to the Revolution. The
following excerpts provide a study in contrasts.
Emiliano Zapata
If he dandied up on holidays and trotted around the
village and into the nearby town of Villa de Ayala
on a silver-saddled horse, the people never
questioned that he was still one of them. Despite
his fine horses and suits, Anenecuilcans never
referred to him as Don Emiliano, which would
have removed him from the guts and flies and
manure and mud of local life, sterilizing the real
respect they felt for him into a squire’s vague
respectability. He was one of their own, they felt in
Anenecuilco, and it never made them
uncomfortable to treat him so. “Miliano,” they
called him, and when he died, pobrecito – poor
little thing. To them he was a neighbor, a younger
cousin who could lead the clan, a beloved nephew
as rough and true as seasoned timber.4

Presidential chair, seated next to General Emiliano
Zapata. The revolutionary leaders are surrounded

Palace, ca. 1915. (Library of Congress)
Francisco “Pancho” Villa
Villa was an outlaw for twenty-two years. When he
was only a boy of sixteen, delivering milk in the
streets of Chihuahua, he killed a government
official and had to take to the mountains . . . His
reckless and romantic bravery is the subject of
countless poems. They tell, for example, how one
of his band named Reza was captured by the
rurales and bribed to betray Villa. Villa heard of it
and sent word into the city of Chihuahua that he
was coming for Reza. In broad daylight he entered
336the city on horseback, took ice-cream on the Plaza
– the ballad is very explicit on this point – and rode
up and down the streets until he found Reza
strolling with his sweetheart in the Sunday crowd
on the Paseo Bolívar, where he shot him and
escaped. In time of famine he fed whole districts,
and took care of entire villages evicted by the
soldiers under Porfírio Díaz’s outrageous land law.
Everywhere he was known as the Friend of the
poor. He was the Mexican Robin Hood.5
Venustiano Carranza
It was Venustiano Carranza, a man of upright life
and high ideals; an aristocrat, descended from the
dominant Spanish race; a great landowner, as his
family had always been great landowners; and one
of the Mexican nobles who, like a few French
nobles such as Lafayette in the French Revolution,
threw themselves heart and soul into the struggle
for liberty. When the Madero Revolution broke out
Carranza took the field in truly medieval fashion.
He armed the peons who worked upon his great
estates, and led theme to war like a feudal overlord
. . .
6
Venustiano Carranza was elected president of Mexico, but
he ignored most of the laws (including the new
Constitution through which he ruled), alienated his
previous supporters, and galvanized his enemies. He was
ousted in a military coup in 1920 led by his former ally,
337Álvaro Obregón (1880–1928), the general from Sonora
who held the presidency until 1924. Although faced with a
rebellion at the end of his term, Obregón managed to
install his chosen successor, fellow Sonoran Plutarco Elías
Calles (1877–1945), a more liberal president and one
whose efforts to carry out land reforms and curb the power
of the Church angered both the Catholic hierarchy and the
US government.
The Constitution of 1917
The 1917 Constitution is the main record of the gains of
the Mexican Revolution, although the document may have
seemed premature since formal hostilities did not draw to a
close until the late 1920s. Not until 1940 did a president
enter and leave office peacefully, when Lázaro Cárdenas
(1895–1970) departed after a six-year term during which
he enacted some of the greatest social reforms in Mexican
history. Thus despite the election of Carranza in 1917 as
the first constitutional president since Madero’s brief,
abortive tenure in 1910–11, and despite the writing of the
Constitution that same year, violence characterized the
revolutionary process and interfered with the peaceful
transition of authority. Without a doubt the laws, ideology,
and mandates expressed in the Constitution were more
symbolic of the direction that many of Mexico’s key
political leaders, activists, and intellectuals wanted the
country to follow, than where it was actually headed.
Certainly all constitutions are mere pieces of paper that
lack importance outside the force of law; however, the
Mexican Constitution was that and even more. It was the
product of some of the country’s chief agrarian reformers,
who had thrown their weight behind General Obregón, a
338man who understood that the basis for power in Mexico
rested in the countryside. President Carranza, it has been
argued, would have returned Mexico to a land tenure
system not different from that of 1910, and would have
reinstated the reform constitution of 1857 with a few
cosmetic changes, such as preventing a president from
succeeding himself, since that had been his chief complaint
against Porfirio Díaz. Without offering any details,
Carranza called for the vague outlines of “legislation for
the improvement of the condition of the rural peon, the
worker, the miner, and in general the proletarian classes.”
However, because the masses had been mobilized, they
saw things differently.
When the group of reformers came together in Querétaro
in 1916, they set about writing an entirely new document,
amounting to a wish list for the achievements of the
Revolution. When Carranza assumed the presidency in
May 1917, as the war came to an end, hopeful forces
turned their attention toward institutionalizing the most
important feature of the revolutionary process: agrarian
reform. The result was Article 27. At 2,500 words the
article was a discourse on the principles, and failures, of
private property. As the central tenet of the Constitution,
the land reform article was a far-reaching prescription for
the equitable distribution of land, written by the most
radical segments of the new government. But it lacked
Carranza’s approval, as well as any inclination on his part
to follow through by transforming the redistribution plan
into reality. In a sweeping blow to landowners and private
property, the law nationalized all land and water and
declared that all individual property rights derived from
the national patrimony. Whereas individuals and groups
339could own land, neither the Church nor foreigners could
own the subsoil. Article 3 placed responsibility for
education in the hands of the government, which was
mandated to provide free and secular education to all from
childhood. The cornerstone of Article 3 was the
elimination of the Catholic Church’s monopoly on the
educational system, a modern reform that so infuriated the
church hierarchy that it immediately began to conspire to
overthrow the government and restore ecclesiastical
authority.
Another highly controversial provision was contained in
Article 123, which guaranteed some of the most
progressive labor legislation anywhere, including an
eighthour workday, a minimum wage adequate to cover a
worker’s basic needs, double pay for overtime, equal pay
for equal work, social security and workers’ compensation.
Employers were also required to provide housing, as well
as medical and educational facilities. Discrimination by
race and gender was outlawed, although, oddly, women
did not get the right to vote. They would wait until 1954
for the franchise, making Mexico, with all its revolutionary
rhetoric, one of the most conservative countries of the
Americas with regard to women’s rights. In contrast,
workers (mainly men) gained some of the most
progressive rights of the time: they were granted the right
to strike and organize, meaning the Mexican labor
movement obtained as a constitutional guarantee the rights
other laborers in Europe, the US and elsewhere were still
only demanding.
Aftermath of Struggle
340Constitutional gains aside, for the mass of rural Mexicans
the Revolution was a time of hardship, widespread hunger,
dislocation, and arbitrary violence. Esperanza, the peasant
woman interviewed by anthropologist Oscar Lewis,
remembers it as a “. . . dreadful time. We suffered a lot. I
no longer had clothing and I wore a soldier’s khaki shirt.
For Pedro [her husband] I had to make a shirt of some
heavy unbleached muslin.” She recounts their constant
travels because Pedro had fought with the Zapatistas as a
result of which they had to leave their village to avoid the
authorities. In their wanderings from one village to another
in search of relatives to take them in, the children suffered
the most. Esperanza resorted to a series of transitory house
servant positions in different towns, remembering:
I would take my two children along so they could be at my
side in the master’s house. We had another boy, Manuel,
but he died of smallpox in Azteca. Then María and
Gonzalo also died on me and I was left alone. The girl died
of a sickness. She got very thin and as it was the time of
the Revolution, there was no doctor to go to and she died
without medicine. The boy died of a scorpion sting.7
After the Revolution the small family, now with a new
child and another on the way, returned to their original
village where “Pedro began to work in the fields. He
planted the tlacolol [a primitive form of agriculture done
with a rough stick] and hired himself out as a field hand
and in the dry season he made rope.”8 More than eight
years after their first contact with the Revolution, the
Martínez family returned to their original village, having
withstood hunger, life-threatening illness, the loss of three
children and the birth of two others, and took up work that
341was unchanged – except perhaps for the worse – from the
time of the outbreak of conflict. The lives of Pedro and
Esperanza Martínez mirrored those of millions of others.
Although the Constitution of 1917 embraced some of the
most radical reforms of any government document
anywhere at the time, the problem of enforcement was
real. Carranza is said to have greeted the new constitution
with the old Spanish adage from the days of the Conquest:
“obedezco pero no cumplo” (I obey but do not comply).
This saying is attributed to the Conquistadores who, far
from the oversight of the Iberian Crown, refused to carry
out the New Laws of the sixteenth century banning Indian
enslavement. Similarly, their twentieth-century
counterparts ignored the provisions guaranteeing equal
distribution of the nation’s most valuable resource: its
land. Nevertheless, some change occurred. The ejido
(communally held land belonging to indigenous towns)
was allowed to continue, the power of the Church was
greatly restrained, foreign companies no longer ruled
supreme, and the resources of the Mexican nation were
held proudly as a part of the national patrimony. The
reforms met with fierce opposition from the Church and
the ruling elite, but it was not until the 1990s, in the
aftermath of a profound economic crisis, that Articles 3
and 27 were significantly rolled back. The Mexican
government agreed to allow the Church broader ownership
rights through an agreement with the Vatican in 1992,
while subsoil rights and access to Mexico’s substantial oil
reserves were relaxed to allow US stewardship.
Nonetheless, at the time gains by Mexican reformers
placed them squarely in the camp that was adopting
socialist practices; although the latter were carried out
342unevenly, they still represented a significant break with the
past.
Violence marred the political process, despite the lofty
words of Mexico’s progressive Constitution. The goals of
freedom and equality advanced by Villa and Zapata that
had rallied the common foot soldiers, along with women,
children, and men of the countryside, to the revolutionary
cause proved elusive. Zapata fell into a trap set by
Carranza in 1919, while Villa eluded his captors for years
in a cat-and-mouse pursuit through the dry and sparsely
populated northern states, only to be killed by Obregón’s
men in 1923. Obregón then ousted Carranza (and had him
killed) as one faction sought to eliminate the other in a
bloody quest for power. Only several years after the end of
hostilities did Mexico settle into the peaceful transition of
power; and then its political elite embraced stability with a
vengeance, or so it seemed. Consolidated within the
Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI, Partido
Revolucionário Institucional), from 1946 until 2000
Mexico was governed by a corporate-technocratic-pro-US
political system that – curiously, given the struggle of
1910 – re-elected itself with no substantial opposition for
the next half-century. At the dawn of the twenty-first
century, new parties on the left and right, along with new
social movements, sought to establish a political discourse
separate from the PRI’s empty revolutionary slogans.
Agrarian Revolts in Latin America
While Mexico underwent a full-scale revolution, smaller
rural rebellions broke out in many Latin American
countries in reaction to political changes in distant capitals.
343Sometimes disorder erupted in opposition to poorly
understood and inadequately explained mandates from
remote capitals. People distrusted leaders in urban areas as
well. In cities the mass of people were physically close to
their government, but poverty, illiteracy, class and racial
segregation held the mass of people at a distance from
their government. In both rural and urban areas, the masses
were frequently distrustful and wary of change, even if it
was supposed to improve their lot.
As the Mexican Revolution drew to a close, a different
type of rebellion erupted in the state of Jalisco against the
liberal gains this very conflict had won. From 1918 until
peace returned in 1929 people from rural areas outside the
city of Guadalajara, southwest of Mexico City, united in
protest against restrictions on the authority of the Catholic
Church imposed by the new Constitution. The insurgents
were called Cristeros because they claimed to be acting in
the interest of the one true (Catholic) Christ. They attacked
Protestants, burned government buildings, and marched
against local authorities, following the direction of activist
clergymen who railed against the secular authorities. What
on the surface appeared to be a rebellion of devout
peasants, being manipulated by conservative landowners
and Catholic priests opposed to the reforms of the
Revolution, was actually more complicated. As recent
scholarship has shown, many of the rebels were actually
objecting to the government’s agrarian reforms (or lack
thereof) that deprived the peasantry of their rightful title to
the land. Religion was for many who joined the rebellion a
tangential issue that provided an umbrella under which
longstanding grievances against land policies favoring the
rich and robbing the poor of access to land could be
344addressed. Some ardent Catholics supported the
government and its reforms, while the religious ties of
others were fairly tenuous.
The Mexican government ignored the peasants’ demands,
denounced their claims as illegitimate, and argued that
superstitious rural dwellers were being terrorized by priests
into believing that the secular reforms would damn the
devout to hell in the hereafter. In 1926 President Calles
retaliated against the clergy in Jalisco by ordering the
churches of the area to be bolted shut, in which state they
remained for the next two years. He ignored peasants’
demands that the government enforce the agrarian reform
act of the Constitution and redress grievances dating back
to the mid-nineteenth-century Reforma. Calles probably
found it easier to punish the priests than to meet the
demands of the peasantry. After all, the Church invoked
little sympathy from many quarters of Mexican society,
evidenced by the surprisingly feeble response that church
closings engendered among most Catholics. Eventually the
Catholic Church withdrew its demands, fearing that the
mass of the faithful might grow accustomed to the absence
of the clergy and cease to require their services. The
complaints of rural dwellers likewise died out but,
according to Mexican historian Jean Meyer, resurfaced in
succeeding decades.
The Cristero Rebellion was not unique among rural, and
even urban, uprisings that appear on the surface to promote
a backward-looking agenda, but on deeper probing reveal
rational economic and political grievances. In the Brazilian
state of Pernambuco from 1893 to 1897, self-declared
prophet, Antonio Conselheiro (the “Counselor”), called
345upon his followers to withhold taxes and, eventually, to
overthrow the newly installed republican government in
Rio de Janeiro, and demand the return of the monarchy.
Denounced as a reactionary, anti-modern, and superstitious
uprising of religious fanatics, the government in Rio de
Janeiro launched four full-scale military assaults against
the settlement of Canudos, where Conselheiro and his
followers were gathered. Further investigation of the
Canudos rebellion shows that, like the Cristeros in Mexico,
the backlanders’ demands went beyond religious devotion
and were more complicated than a tax revolt and general
denunciation of distant authorities. Since its installation in
1889 the Brazilian Republic had backed the incorporation
of land in the northeast into the hands of what were
considered to be “productive” landowners.
Simultaneously, rural laborers were forced into the employ
of the landowners at whatever wage was offered. The
Republic – and nineteenth-century liberalism – held no
place for the landless, eschewed genuine land reform with
the potential for nurturing small farming communities, and
relied instead on an easy rejection of the backlanders’
demands by dismissing the protesters as superstitious,
backward monarchists.
In the last days of the nineteenth century a rebellion in the
highlands of Bolivia pitted indigenous peasants against
modernizing industrialists intent on building the
import–export market. The Indian leader Pablo Zárate
Willka (?–1905) organized a mass uprising of those
peasants who were being thrown off their land in the
northern Altiplano. Neither of Bolivia’s two major
political parties gave an ear to the demands of the
indigenous population. The Conservative Party represented
346the landowners and silver-mining elite and the Liberal
Party backed industrialization, private property, and an
expanded market economy. No one in power cared that the
much-heralded “progress” and “civilization” did anything
for the Indians who formed the vast majority of the
population and were losing their land to capitalist land and
mine owners. The Zárate Willka uprising exploded into a
massacre of all whites regardless of their economic status.
The political forces in distant La Paz and Sucre
condemned the Indians as barbarians, claiming that the
latter were incapable of joining the body politic of a
modernizing nation. In the face of the indigenous uprising,
the Liberals and Conservatives buried their differences and
united in a brutal fratricidal repression of the Indian
peasantry.
Neither the Cristeros in Jalisco nor Conselheiro’s followers
in Canudos nor the participants in the Zárate Willka
rebellion were all of one thing or the other. In Brazil and
Mexico undoubtedly many of the insurgents were
motivated by religious devotion, even fanaticism in some
cases, but they were also participants in rebellions that are
not uncommon during periods of transition. In Bolivia, a
Spanish-language requirement for voting meant that over
50 percent of the population was ineligible to legally
participate in the management of their own affairs.
Moreover, historians estimate that from 10 to 15 percent of
the population had access to nothing but the barest
mechanisms of the political system. As governments
changed hands and declared new priorities, most of the
people were left behind. Debates over “reform” and
“liberal” agendas, heated political rivalries over the road to
economic development, went on in far-off capitals and
347even foreign lands. The poor, isolated, and purposefully
left ignorant masses used whatever mechanisms were
available to them to seek redress for their grievances.
Unfortunately, more often than not, distant, impersonal
governments and constitutions failed to come to their aid.
Conclusion
As the twentieth century got underway, Latin America was
a study in contrasts. Its vast agricultural regions, the
produce of which is often considered the continent’s
greatest resource, turned out a wealth of commodities for
the international market but many parts of the countryside
remained unaffected by the wealth and promise of growing
export–import markets. As mentioned in earlier chapters,
there was a story at each end of the commodity chain
bridge, and for Latin America that story was paradoxical.
In the countryside, previous forms of coerced labor,
patterns of land distribution, and patriarchal authority
persisted in some areas and came under attack in others.
Mexico was host to a revolutionary transformation that
affected the peasantry, miners, and industrial and service
workers. Revolution rolled through the countryside and
reached urban dwellers as well, building from the original
calls for fair elections and a return to constitutional law
until it reached a crescendo of demands for greater equality
and social justice across ethnic and class lines. Standard
bastions of conservatism – the Church, landowners, their
allies among the political and intellectual elite – fought to
hold on to their traditional privileges while women, the
poor, workers, and the dispossessed sought to widen
democracy.
348The search for a better life was not solely the goal of
Mexicans, rather it was a goal of men and women in other
countries at other times. Historians have long investigated
popular uprisings that on the surface appeared as futile,
even misguided, only to discover on deeper investigation
that events such as Canudos or Zárate Willka were genuine
and determined attempts to redress profound social
inequalities. The revolts in Mexico, Bolivia, and Brazil
touched on here provide snapshots of the actions of both
leaders and ordinary people in playing a part in
transforming the world in which they lived.

The Left and the Socialist Alternative
The Mexican Revolution originally centered among rural
peasants and miners, spilled over into the cities and drew
in urban workers, the emerging middle class, intellectuals,
professionals, artists, and masses of displaced rural and
urban dwellers. In other countries of Latin America, where
manufacturing was contributing to an expanding and
prosperous economy, the working class (many of them
immigrants with experience in European labor struggles)
likewise began to organize itself into trade unions, mutual
benefit societies, ethnic and social clubs, and city-wide
labor federations as mechanisms through which to defend
their class interest.
Socialism on the World Stage
By the end of World War I – or the Great War, as it was
called – left-wing alternatives, including socialism,
anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalism (a trade unionist form
of anarchism that advocated the unity of all workers and
their sympathizers into one big union or federation of
unions), predominated in labor movements throughout the
world. With the triumph of the Russian Revolution in
1917, communist parties formed in most European
countries in support of the Bolsheviks. In 1919 socialists in
the Soviet Union and Europe formed the Comintern
(sometimes called the Communist, or Third, International),
a meeting of all Marxist socialist groups in the world. The
Comintern became the representative body uniting
350hundreds of socialist parties, as well as thousands of
socialist and anarchist individuals and small groups, local
and regional Marxist study circles, newspapers, and other
unaffiliated left parties and tendencies, into a disciplined
international movement. The Argentine Socialist Party
changed its name to the Communist Party in 1918 and
voted (through an Italian proxy) as a founding member of
the Comintern, the only Latin American party represented.
Socialist parties in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and
Cuba followed suit; by the end of the 1920s communist
parties existed in every Latin American country.
Between World War I and World War II, Latin American
trade union movements were the site of intense ideological
debate between communist, socialist, and anarchist
tendencies regarding the best alternative for the future of
the labor movement, and society in general. Although
disagreements were at times intense among leftist parties,
socialism was a widely recognized choice among labor
militants and social activists for creating equitable
societies. By the end of the 1930s, fascism emerged as
socialism’s most formidable opponent in many parts of
Latin America, especially Brazil and Argentina, and, as in
Mussolini’s Italy, began to win over a segment of the
middle class, the manufacturing and commercial
bourgeoisie.
It is not possible to delve into the intricacies of these
ideological debates here. It can be said, however, that for
the most part some form of left-wing option, clustered
around Marxist and/or Marxist-Leninist principles, held
sway among a considerable portion of the Latin American
labor movement throughout the twentieth century. They
351followed directives from Moscow and frequently parodied
the Soviet line. In the early years of the twenty-firstcentury
socialism was, and still is – even after the breakup of the
Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War – one of the
most widely recognized alternatives to capitalism and the
status quo embraced by movements for social change.
Communist parties have taken a back seat on the world
stage since 1990, and all but disappeared in many parts of
Latin America. But communism with a small “c” and its
associated socialist, leftist ideals remains as an overt
strategy in social movements and an acknowledged player
in Latin America’s ongoing class conflict. The
contemporary “Pink Tide,” of left-leaning governments in
many Latin American countries today contains elements of
political movements that hark back more than a
half-century. This issue will be examined more fully in the
final chapter.
Social Reform and the Middle Class
The coalescence of immigration, industrial expansion,
dynamic trade, prosperity, and a rapidly expanding
government and commercial bureaucracy made Argentina,
particularly Buenos Aires, an important arena for new
forms of class conflict. Immigrants brought with them
from the northern regions of Italy a familiarity with
socialist and anarchist principles and a sense of
class-consciousness that made them aware of their own
role in the nation’s prosperity, and of the validity of their
demand for a share in it. If the political and economic elite
was heralding Argentina as one of the world’s richest
countries, and financing opera houses, boulevards, concert
halls, parks, and the accoutrements of fine European living
352for themselves, it was only logical that workers would join
together to demand a share of the nation’s wealth as well.
Since the traditional landholding elite had shown little
interest in meeting workers’ demands, or even in
understanding the new immigrant culture dominating the
urban landscape, a party largely representative of the
middle class emerged with the political will to both
ameliorate class conflict and define a political line between
the extremes.
The middle class had grown considerably with the
formation of a large government and entrepreneurial
bureaucracy, and included a considerable number of
professionals, shopkeepers, and managers. Middle-class
activists pursued a program of social reform in hopes of
expanding opportunities for everyone in society, and
thereby enlarging the prospects of a political class that
could challenge the power of the old oligarchy. Largely as
a result of pressure from middle-class reformers such as
Domingo Sarmiento (1811–88), schooling was made
mandatory in 1884 and primary instruction was removed
from the authority of the Catholic Church – no small feat
in a country with a Catholic majority – and immigrants
who needed to send their children into factories, not to
school, to help support the family. With an 80 percent
literacy rate by 1914, Argentina became the most educated
country of South America. Under the leadership of
Hipólito Yrigoyen (1852–1933), the Radical Civic Union
(UCR) developed as the political organ of the middle class
and the means through which Yrigoyen won the
presidency for the first time in 1916 and served two terms
(although not consecutively). Despite the UCR’s claim to
stand for democratic institutions, universal male suffrage,
353and educational and labor reforms, the Radicals never
succeeded in mediating between the power of ranchers and
large landholders on the right and the increasingly
powerful labor movement, coalescing under the
anarcho-syndicalist banner, on the left. The Radicals’ hold
was always sporadic and transitory, not unlike
middle-class experiments in other Latin American
countries.
Anarchism, Socialism, and Anarcho-syndicalism
In contrast to the loose affiliations of middle-class
reformers, the working class formed a demographically
much larger group and held the potential for demanding
greater equality, a better standard of living, and an active
role in national governance. Since the Argentine working
class has been the most organized industrial labor force in
Latin America, it often stands as the main example of trade
unionism and radical, socialist, and anarchist urban politics
on the continent. It had the largest labor confederation, in
the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina (FORA,
Regional Federation of Argentine Workers), in which
nearly a quarter of the Buenos Aires workforce was
enrolled by 1918, the year that the Argentine Communist
Party (PCA) was founded.
Argentina was not alone. Militant and leftist labor
organizations proliferated during this era up and down the
continent, where thousands of men and women came
together in strikes, worker demonstrations, and
community-based protests to demand better living and
working conditions. In Brazil the Confederação Operária
Brasileira (COB, Brazilian Labor Confederation) formed
354in 1908 in both major cities (Rio de Janeiro and São
Paulo), where it was effective in leading opposition
movements. From 1917 to 1921 anarchist and
communist-inspired trade unions led a series of general
strikes in São Paulo for higher wages, better working
conditions, an eight-hour workday, and union recognition.
The largest occurred in 1917 when women workers at the
Rodolfo Crespi textile mill walked out after being turned
down for a 25 percent wage increase. The strike soon
spread to all workers in the mill, men and women, and
from textiles to other industries. Under the coordination of
a citywide confederation of labor leaders, the São Paulo
Committee in Defense of the Proletariat, a general strike
closed down nearly the entire city in June and July of
1917. The city’s leading newspaper, O Estado de São
Paulo, estimated that 20,000 workers were on strike by
July 12 and that most workshops, mills, factories, utilities,
and transportation networks were at a standstill. The strike
proved very successful. On July 14 the city’s leading
industrialists met with Committee representatives to offer a
20 percent wage increase, union recognition, no reprisals
against those who had been on strike, and a promise to
“improve the moral, material and economic conditions of
the São Paulo working force.”1
Women in the Workforce
A very high percentage of immigrants in Buenos Aires at
the turn of the century were women, whose rate of
participation in the paid workforce surpassed that in most
other parts of Latin America. By 1887 the Buenos Aires
census recorded that women comprised 39 percent of the
paid workforce, often working under terrible conditions. In
355the last decade of the century Dr. Juan Bialet Masse of the
National Labor Department traveled throughout Argentina
compiling a record of the living and working conditions of
the laboring poor. Although he noted that most laborers
endured horrible living conditions, a miserable work
environment, and were employed at unsteady jobs for very
low pay, he found that women had the worst situation of
all. They were paid less, had no job security and no chance
of moving beyond the most menial, entry-level positions.
Subsequent studies have shown that women in laundries
were required to work 11and 12-hour days, with almost no
rest breaks. They were paid 2.60 pesos a day, about half
the wage paid to men, and – along with children, who
received just one-quarter of what men earned – endured
deplorable conditions. Laundries were reasonably
profitable enterprises for their owners, most likely because
of the extremely low wages paid to the largely female and
underage workforce (Figure 8.1). Women suffered from a
number of maladies, including rheumatism, sciatica, and
menstrual irregularities, in addition to a very high
incidence of tuberculosis, which affected the population as
a whole.
Notwithstanding their plight, the government pointed to
the large number of women at work as indicative of the
high level of “culture and progress” Argentine society had
achieved, regardless of the miserable conditions under
which women labored. Occasional attempts to pass
protective legislation, unsuccessfully promoted by the
Radicals when they were in office, failed, while the few
protections accorded women tended to contribute to their
low wages and generally inferior status. Adult married
women were considered legal minors and, when not
356married, no matter their age, were under the control of
their fathers. Thus both husbands and fathers, and even
older brothers, had the right to dispose of their earnings.
They were denied the right to vote and hold office.
Argentine women were subject to the paradox common to
women in many industrializing societies: they were denied
all rights by virtue of their status as the “weaker sex,” but
were forced into the harshest work for the least amount of
pay. Nevertheless, in the early decades of the twentieth
century Argentina passed some of the most comprehensive
protective legislation for women of any country of Latin
America, comparable to parts of Europe. But,
unfortunately, work standards for women and children
were universally low.
Figure 8.1 The tenement (conventillo) patio was the hub
of the working-class community in cities. It served as a
communal laundry for women who took in washing from
families throughout the city, as a playground, and as a
communal meeting area. (Harry Grant Olds photographs
from Valparaiso, Chile, ca. 1900. In author’s possession)
357Throughout Latin America the World War I era (1914–18)
was a time of economic instability. Some workplaces ran
at full capacity turning out provisions for the European
army, while others were forced to slow down production
considerably because of the scarcity of, and highly inflated
costs for, raw materials. Workers and consumers
complained bitterly of inflation, shortages, and price
gouging, blaming the government for failure to oversee the
equitable supply of basic needs at affordable prices. In
response, labor militancy increased throughout Latin
America, especially in Colombia, Cuba, Peru, and
Uruguay, where labor organizing had been previously less
pronounced.
Colombia: Resistance to the United Fruit Company
358In Colombia the boom in coffee exports began in the early
years of the century and grew from one million bags (60
kilos each) in 1913 to three million bags yearly by the end
of the 1920s, making coffee the leading export. Other
economically expanding sectors were oil production and
the cultivation and export of fruit, especially bananas.
Labor militancy and protest broke out first among
Colombian dockworkers, but the government, anxious to
grow the export sector and to build on the new-found
prosperity following years of internal conflict (especially
the 1899–1902 Thousand Days War that intermittently
paralyzed Colombian productivity), responded by
outlawing strikes, invading meetings of labor activists, and
closing down nascent organizations. Petroleum workers
struck in Barrancabermeja in the mid- and late 1920s, and
banana pickers and haulers staged a massive strike and
protest in 1928.
The banana workers’ strike, and resultant repression, was a
major moment in the United Fruit Company’s history in
Colombia; the “banana massacre” was immortalized for
readers around the world in Gabriel García Márquez’s
novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude. The Boston-based
United Fruit Company was formed in 1899 as a result of
the merger of the Boston Fruit Company and the banana
business owned by another Bostonian, Minor Keith. The
company’s tentacles reached into every corner of the
production and export enterprise, earning it the name “El
Pulpo” or “The Octopus.” By the beginning of 1900 it was
a major landholder and employer in Colombia. Managers
who came to Colombia were largely from the south of the
United States and intermingled little with the ordinary,
mixed-race workers on their plantations. In an interview
359García Márquez described his childhood memories of the
“banana fever” that overtook his hometown of Aracataca
beginning in 1910 with the arrival of United Fruit. He
remembered “the wire fences; the ever-neat green lawns;
the swimming pools with outdoor tables and umbrellas; the
tall, blond, ruddy-faced men in their explorer outfits; their
wives decked out in muslin dresses; and their adolescent
daughters, playing tennis or going for casual drives in their
convertibles around Aracataca.” This memory of managers
from another country, living in isolation from the people
who worked for them, was, he remarked, his first
impression of “great-power colonialism.” Years later, it
would figure in his novel.2
Isolated from ordinary Colombians, North American
managers had no compunctions about enforcing harsh
working conditions for little pay. In response, workers
began to organize for improved living and working
conditions, including the right to form a union to represent
their interests. When 32,000 banana workers struck United
Fruit on October 7, 1928, the company initially relied on
its own guards to disrupt the picketers, but when these
intimidation methods failed, United Fruit called in
government troops to put down the strike in Ciénaga (see
Box 8.1). The 1928 massacre of banana strikers was a
shocking event in Colombian history, prompting calls for
an investigation and retaliation against the American
conglomerate and the army. A young lawyer, Jorge Eliécer
Gaitán (1898–1948), who would reach prominence in
subsequent decades, made his reputation in the Liberal
Party by calling for an investigation into the 1928
massacre, but to little avail.
360Box 8.1 The banana strike
The massacre of the banana workers in One
Hundred Years of Solitude is a powerfully written,
fictionalized depiction of the real historic labor
struggle:
When José Arcadio Segundo came to he was lying
face up in the darkness. He realized that he was
riding on an endless and silent train and that his
head was caked with dry blood and that all his
bones ached. He felt an intolerable desire to sleep.
Prepared to sleep for many hours, safe from the
terror and the horror, he made himself comfortable
on the side that pained him less, and only then did
he discover that he was lying against dead people...
Several hours must have passed since the massacre
because the corpses had the same temperature as
plaster in autumn and the same consistency of
petrified foam that it had, and those who had put
them in the car had had time to pile them up in the
same way in which they transported bunches of
bananas.
From Gabriel García Márquez, One Hundred Years
of Solitude, translated by Gregory Rabassa (New
York: Harper and Row, 1967), p. 329.
While the image of José Arcadio Segundo awaking
to find himself buried among dead bodies is
361horrendous, even worse was the outcome of the
massacre. García Márquez tells his readers that it
began to rain in the mythical town of Macondo for
months on end, and when the people emerged from
the deluge they were so happy to see the sun they
forgot all about the massacre. Hence García
Márquez wryly fictionalizes how thousands can die
but no one remembers.
The Labor Movement
During the first decades of the twentieth century, labor
organizations followed one of two courses, both within the
leftist political spectrum. One wing of the movement
wanted to achieve socialism through the electoral process,
voting for presidents and members of congress, while the
other wing dismissed and distrusted the electoral arena,
preferring instead to organize directly through trade
unions, utilizing general strikes and labor agitation to win
support from the masses and take over the government.
The anarchosyndicalists exerted considerable strength in
urban areas of Argentina, southern Brazil, Chile
(especially the port at Valparaiso), and Mexico.
Like Buenos Aires, Brazil’s leading industrial city, São
Paulo, had grown rapidly from a population of 239,820 in
1900 to 1,033,202 by 1934. Social strife compounded as
labor militancy accompanied the growth in industries and
workers demanded the right to organize and strike if
necessary to win higher wages. In response to many urban
problems – the city was dangerous, epidemics were
362frequent, living conditions unsanitary, cramped, unsafe,
and often menacing – workers attempted another general
strike in 1919, but it did not prove successful. The
Brazilian Communist Party formed in 1920 and, although
never large, drew to it some of the foremost factory
organizers and early anarchist trade unionists who, in turn,
played a strong role in raising worker consciousness
during the subsequent decade. Nevertheless, demands for
higher wages and better working conditions fell on deaf
ears. Even in the face of widespread walkouts,
industrialists relied on repression, backed by the army, to
crush strikes and break up picket lines, following a pattern
similar to that in Colombia. Operating on the assumption,
or pretext, that labor unrest resulted from the influx of
foreigners, rather than issues of working conditions and
wages, entrepreneurs and factory owners pressured
governments in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and
Uruguay to pass laws that made the expulsion of
foreign-born workers a common response to strikes or
labor disputes. At the same time some governments, with
support from liberal, middle-class reformers and the
Catholic Church, passed protective legislation ending child
labor, restricting women’s work in dangerous jobs, and
mandating Sunday as a day of rest. Reformist measures of
the era ran the gamut from real labor reform to
paternalistic, short-term measures introduced to stave off
confrontations.
Socialism and the Arts
The transformations sweeping Latin America’s political
landscape were reflected dramatically in new forms of
artistic expression. Among Mexico’s cultural workers the
363battle over the successes and failures of the Revolution
continued after formal hostilities had come to an end.
Probably more than any other group, Mexico’s artists
sought to interpret that struggle in terms of class conflict
and to present Mexico’s history to the world at large
through an uncompromising socialist vision, depicting in
bold relief the oppression of peasants and the urban
working class by one set of rulers after another from the
sixteenth century onward. Under the sponsorship of José
Vasconcelos (18821959), Minister of Education from 1921
to 1924, post-revolution Mexico embarked on an era of
unprecedented artistic expression, both at home and on the
world stage of revolutionary art. This public rendering of
politics into art, along with the pure expression of beauty
and color, was unique in the art world of the time.
The words “mural,” “muralists,” and “muralism” all
invoke Mexico and the names most associated with that art
form: José Clemente Orozco (1883–1949), Diego Rivera
(1886–1957), and David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896–1974).
Muralists drew on the sharp political portrayals of the Díaz
dictatorship popularized by printmaker José Guadalupe
Posada (1852–1913). Posada’s animated skeletons enjoyed
popularity during his lifetime as inexpensive illustrations
for Day of the Dead celebrations in late October and early
November, as catchy commercial images on flyers and
advertisements, and in newspapers as satirical political
commentary on the political and economic elite. Despite
the popularity of his images, while he was alive Posada
was not considered an artist, or even a serious illustrator,
in the art world’s more influential circles. Later
generations of artists and illustrators, however, especially
the muralists whose careers overlapped with Posada’s,
364embraced the satire and themes of picaresque Mexican
street characters represented in his art. Moreover, Posada’s
skeletal figures have been phenomenally enduring, finding
their way into literally thousands of books, calendars, and
other publications that portray popular culture or Mexican
artwork (Figure 8.2).
The key themes running through the artistic explosion of
the post-revolutionary era were nationalism; indigenismo;
glorification of rural and urban labor and the working man,
woman, and child; social criticism to the point of ridicule
and mockery; and denunciation of the national and,
especially, international ruling classes – all done in bold
lines, colors, and shapes. For the muralists, whose politics
ranged along the Marxist spectrum from socialist to
committed communist, the people of Mexico had nothing
to apologize for, no reason to humble themselves at the
feet of the world’s elite. The oppressed Indian had suffered
at the hands of the Spanish, British bankers, Rockefeller
oilmen, and armies of repression both at home and abroad.
It was, as the muralists unabashedly and graphically
declared, time for the oppressed to throw off their chains
and assume their place as the decent, hardworking, and
worthy salt of the earth. Diego Rivera’s illustrated history
of Mexico, which graces the walls of the Palace of Justice
on the Zócolo plaza in Mexico City, leaves no doubt of his
conviction that the purity of Mexico lies in its Indian and
peasant masses.
In other works, especially the celebrated murals originally
intended for Rockefeller Center in New York City (but
painted over when the artist refused to bow to
Rockefeller’s demand that he remove the favorable images
365of socialist icons and heroes of the Russian Revolution,
Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky), Rivera heralded the
redemptive power of the machine. The murals suggested
that, put to the use of the betterment of the masses machine
technology would ease the drudgery of work, but if left in
the hands of the international bourgeoisie, would bring to
the world only war and possible annihilation. The mural,
which Rivera subsequently reproduced in the Museo de
Bellas Artes in Mexico City, is a paradox. It was
commissioned by the foremost American capitalist, John
D. Rockefeller, to grace his monument to capital
accumulation on Fifth Avenue in New York, yet it relied
on the talent of one of the most highly acclaimed artists of
the moment, Diego Rivera, who came from a country long
dominated, humiliated, and controlled by the US
government and Rockefeller oil interests in particular. But
the historical vision portrayed by Rivera in his mural, fired
by socialist, anti-imperialist fervor, was found to be
unacceptable – even in the country that had long
proclaimed itself to be a beacon of free expression.
Rivera’s refusal to be cowed by the powerful Rockefeller
formed a high point in the symbolic, if not always real,
affirmation of post-revolutionary Mexico’s new-found
sovereignty.
Tenentes Revolt and Brazilian Communism
A similar convergence of art, politics, and revolutionary
upheaval shook Brazil in the 1920s. Unlike Mexico,
however, the uprising did not originate in the countryside
and sweep into urban areas; rather the protest mounted by
a group of disaffected military officers served as the spark
for one of Brazil’s most significant insurgent movements.
366Since the end of the monarchy in 1889 Brazil’s national
politics had alternated between control by powerful coffee
planters in São Paulo and by dairy farmers and cattle
ranchers in Minas Gerais. Loosely referred to as the
alliance of café com leite (literally “coffee and milk”), the
arrangement illustrated the ability of the landed oligarchy,
in alliance with urban commercial and industrial elites, to
maintain control of national leadership. In July 1922 a
group of junior officers, called tenentes, took over the
garrison in Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro, in an attempt to
prevent Artur da Silva Bernardes (1875–1955), the latest
president elected by the power elites of Minas Gerais and
São Paulo, from assuming office. The tenentes denounced
the unchecked dominance of the planter oligarchy and
called for an end to electoral corruption. Although the
young officers fought valiantly, they were easily crushed.
Nonetheless, inspired by Rio’s tenentes, another group of
junior officers rose in revolt in São Paulo in 1924, held the
city from July 5 to 28, and were joined by angry workers,
who raided food warehouses and targeted the holdings of
some of the city’s leading industrialists (who were
considered responsible for keeping food and consumer
prices high). In a bloody counterattack the government
reclaimed control of the city, resulting in the deaths of over
1,000 residents, nearly 4,000 wounded and an estimated
300,000 temporarily driven to the city’s outskirts. Despite
its militancy, the uprising was a complete failure that
probably accentuated the suffering of the city’s poor in the
form of destroyed property, food shortages, and increased
police repression.
Figure 8.2 “Calavera (skull) of Adelita, the Soldadera,”
by José Guadalupe Posada.
367368Hearing of the Paulista revolt a young officer, Luís Carlos
Prestes (1898–1990), from Rio Grande do Sul in the far
South, gathered a group of insurgents to march north in an
audacious move to join their comrades in São Paulo. The
march, called the “Prestes Column,” eventually traveled
14,000 miles through the interior of Brazil from the
Argentine border, across into Bolivia in the North, before
dispersing. Their travels placed them in contact with the
rural peasantry and made the soldiers aware for the first
time of the wretched conditions prevailing in the
countryside. Increasingly drawn to more radical doctrines,
Prestes and his followers expanded their program to
include a full range of demands for land reform along with
improved working and living conditions for urban
workers. Prestes did not, however, succeed in drawing
together a movement powerful enough to threaten the
dominance of the coffee oligarchy. He went on to become
secretary-general of Brazil’s Communist Party in later
years, playing an important role in the transformation of
the Brazilian left (see Box 8.2).
Modern Art Week in Brazil
In a turn of events that echoed political and cultural
changes occurring in Mexico, Brazil witnessed in the
1920s the appearance of radical new artistic and
intellectual movements. Not comparable to the merger of
Marxist politics and art that characterized Mexican
muralists, the Brazilian embrace of modernism,
nonetheless, represented a stark break with the
sentimentalism of earlier artistic expression. Modernism
burst on the scene in 1922 when a group of avant-garde
artists and writers in São Paulo, called the Grupo dos
369Cinco (Group of Five) organized a week of artistic,
literary, and cultural presentations. Led by novelist, poet,
literary and art critic, musicologist, and teacher Mario de
Morais Andrade (1893–1945), the group included Tarsila
do Amaral (18861973), Anita Malfatti (1889–1964),
Oswald de Andrade (1890–1954), and Paulo Menotti del
Picchia (1892–1988). The writers and artists performed
and exhibited work designed to build on Brazilian themes,
celebrate aspects of Brazil’s indigenous and African
cultures, and break with the restrictive and mechanical
styles then in vogue. Initially the public viewed the
exposition with extreme hostility and ridicule, even
damaging some of the paintings and jeering loudly at
public readings. Despite initial rejection by the Paulista
public, over the next 20 years modernism flourished in
Brazil, as both an aesthetic and political movement, until
the foremost artists and writers of the century eventually
embraced it. Modernism as an art movement is credited
not only with bringing Brazilian art and literature into the
modern age, but also with showcasing Brazilian talent to
the world, especially Europe.
Box 8.2 Olga Benário Prestes
The wife and companion of Luís Carlos Prestes,
Olga Benário was also an active participant in
Brazilian communist politics. She was born on
February 12, 1908 in Munich, Germany into a
family prominent in Social Democratic Party
politics. Following in the footsteps of her
370politically active father, Olga became involved in
social struggles at an early age; when she was 15
she joined the Communist Youth International.
Through the organization she became romantically
and politically involved with fellow member Otto
Braun, whom she succeeded in liberating from
prison in 1928, after which the two had to flee
Germany for Moscow. There she eventually
separated from Braun.
Olga Benário met Prestes in 1934 when he visited
Russia, and she was assigned to provide him with
security on his trip back to Brazil. Prestes and
Benário fell in love while traveling across Europe
masquerading as a Portuguese husband and wife,
on their way to Brazil. They returned to Rio de
Janeiro where they participated in the 1935 failed
communist uprising, were imprisoned separately,
and lost touch with each other. She was deported to
Germany in 1936, despite being pregnant with
Prestes’ child, a fact that according to Brazil’s
Constitution should have allowed her to stay in the
country. Being both Jewish and a leftist, she faced
certain incarceration, or worse, upon arrival in
Germany. On November 27, 1937, in the
Barnimstrasse prison for women, she gave birth to
a daughter, Anita Leocádia, who after staying with
her mother for a short time was given over to the
ward of her paternal grandmother. In 1938 Benário
was transferred to the Lichtenburg concentration
371camp, and later to Ravensbrük as World War II
reached full force. At Ravensbrük she became the
head of her prison block and set up classrooms, but
in February of 1942, she and 200 other prisoners of
the camp were sent to the gas chamber. Unaware of
what had happened, Luís Carlos Prestes went to
Europe to find her after the war.
The man heralded as the “Pope of Modernism” was a
writer, not an artist. Mario Morais de Andrade exhorted the
nation and its people to embrace “the true Brazilian
identity,” to recognize their “Tupi Indian soul,” and to
forge a syncretism of European with indigenous and
African cultures in order to achieve a genuine national
identity. He reproduced and analyzed particular words and
speech patterns, especially rough and everyday
colloquialisms, to grasp the essence of Brazilian
psychology as manifested in language. Andrade’s major
work was a dense and mystical story, Macunaima.
Although considered by critics as a masterpiece that
defines the soul of the Brazilian people, both the book and
the movie made from it in the 1970s rely on a logic and
aesthetic that has generally been very hard for foreigners to
grasp. Its earthiness and bawdy sexuality were a shocking
departure from sentimentalism and considered too bold for
most European and US audiences. Brazilian modernism
shared with Mexican muralism a call for the expression of
a non-European, indigenous, and African identity far from
the aesthetic norms adapted from Europe.
372Women in the Arts
Several women were at the forefront of the modernist art
movement in Brazil and Mexico, although for many years
prominent male artists overshadowed their importance.
Tarsila and Malfatti were both from the Brazilian upper
class, and thus not expected or required to have careers,
but were nonetheless encouraged to pursue the study of art
in Europe and Brazil. Malfatti is credited with being the
first artist to incorporate European and Brazilian themes
into paintings, while Tarsila is known for her colorful
abstractions of working people and pastoral settings. But
the most famous Latin American woman artist – indeed
one of the most famous Latin American artists – was
Mexico’s Frida Kahlo (1907–54). In what Mary Kay
Vaughan refers to as “precociously feminist” art, in the
1930s and 1940s Frida Kahlo painted small self-portraits
that captured stark images and engrossing, usually
female-centered, themes not taken up until many decades
later by major women artists such as Judy Chicago. Victim
of a terrible bus accident as a teenager that left her with
painful disabilities, Kahlo turned the culture’s obsession
with female beauty and body image into a vast repertoire
addressing themes of motherhood, domestic violence, male
egoism, and women’s reproductive rights. Married to
Diego Rivera, and thus subjected to his open infidelities,
while engaging in her own extramarital relationships with
both men and women, Kahlo might be seen as the
precursor to the “personal is political” ideology that swept
the modern feminist movement decades later.
In contrast to Rivera and the other muralists, Kahlo did not
use the over-painted, grossly bejeweled figure of a
373bourgeois woman as a symbol of capitalist excess, nor the
subdued and hardworking Indian peasant woman to
represent Mexican purity. Instead, her small, painfully
realistic self-portraits convey a female consciousness that
is at once unsettling and shocking, and meant to contribute
to the debate over the role of women in society. She relied
on clever accoutrements, such as a depiction of herself
with shorn hair in a business suit, or a dramatic
post-abortion scene, or women infusing each other with
blood, to depict the relationship of women to male
authority, control over women’s bodies, and the
importance of female bonding. As Vaughan observes,
although the suffering female body that Kahlo painted
serves today as a source of “emotional identification,” one
cannot forget that the source of her turmoil was her own
“broken body and anguished mind caught between the cult
of motherhood and a man who claimed women’s brains
were his favorite meal.”3 Not surprisingly, Kahlo’s work
remained largely on the margins of an art world dominated
by the more popular and politically charged male muralists
until long after her death. By the end of the twentieth
century, and aided by the promotion her work received
among celebrities Madonna and Salma Hayek (who played
the artist in the 2002 movie, Frida), as well as collectors
and artists in the US and Europe, Frida Kahlo and her
work had reached mega-stardom.
Latin America’s most decorated woman of the arts was a
poet who, like other artists and writers of the era, was also
known for her social criticism. Gabriela Mistral
(1889–1957), a Chilean writer who won the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 1945, was both an activist writer and the
composer of enduring poetry. Born in the Chilean village
374of Vicuña, she has been described by Langston Hughes
and other well-known literary figures as the queen of
Spanish-American literature, the honorary mother of Latin
America, and the purest embodiment of the most basic and
typical essences of her homeland. Although her literary
fame has been mostly linked with poetry, for which she
won the Nobel Prize in 1945, Mistral’s career included
equally unique and prolific works of prose, in which she
espoused controversial educational and political theories.
Mistral, often referred to simply as “Gabriela,” wrote in
paradoxes and contradictions, encompassing such a vast
array of social and political topics that she is hard to
classify. She wrote as a feminist who encouraged women’s
education and freedom, while at the same time defining
women’s rightful place in the domestic sphere. She wrote
as a socialist and as a religious Christian who took her
name from the archangel. She was a pacifist, an
anti-colonialist, and a critic of the effects of
industrialization on human interaction. The posts Mistral
held and the places she lived were equally as diverse, from
her position as a local teacher, to working on school
reform with the Mexican Secretary of Education, and then
representing Chile in the League of Nations, the United
Nations Subcommittee on the Status of Women, and as
Consul to Brazil, Portugal, Nice, and Los Angeles. Much
of her character remains shrouded in mystery, an aura
Mistral cultivated by attending award ceremonies
incognito, creating a pseudonym, Lucila Godoy y
Alcayaga, and never marrying or having children.
It is for this last quality and endless dedication to her
region’s youth that Mistral is known as the adoptive
375mother of Latin America. Perhaps her era’s most
progressive reformer of education, Mistral explored
revolutionary methods of pedagogy, including the use of
visual aids, of great literature, and of games rather than
textbooks. Drawing on her experiences teaching in a
desolate region in southern Chile, she infused her writings
with themes that emphasized the importance of education.
Her most popular poem, Ternura, was once sung aloud by
4,000 Mexican children in her honor. The reputed source
of her unique voice has contributed to her legendary
reputation, something that emerged following the suicide
of her fiancé, whose body was discovered with a postcard
from his betrothed. It was her reaction to his death that
yielded her first and most beloved series of poems and
book in 1914 and 1922, Sonetos de la Muerte and
Desolación. The latter is divided into four sections – Life,
School, Pain, and Nature – unveiling the story of two
lovers who meet, experience intensely passionate romantic
love, followed by the man’s betrayal of his lover, his
subsequent anguish, and suicide. The poem is one of
Mistral’s most well-known works, most likely because it
chronicles the events of her own painful relationship with a
man, presented to her audience in a familiar and accessible
style. By the time of her death in 1957, Mistral’s sojourns
in Europe and the United States, her high-profile work for
social change, along with her poetry and writing, had
rendered her an international icon whose talents were
known the world over.
Socialism vs. Capitalism
The worldwide ideological debate between capitalism and
socialism inspired Mexican muralists and Brazilian
376modernists, served as the foundation for the writers of the
Mexican 1917 Constitution, and motivated reformers in
every sector of Latin American society. Indeed, the most
remarkable change of the twentieth century, introduced in
the wake of the Mexican Revolution and extending into the
social fabric of all of Latin America, was the tension
between socialist communalism and capitalist private
ownership. The impact on Latin America’s nations and
people varied according to many factors, not least of which
were the levels of urban versus rural development, strength
of the labor movement, extent of concepts of unified
nationhood, forces of repression, and the role of individual
political and intellectual leaders.
Certainly, the debate over soc ialism and its various forms
entered the world stage long before the first decade of the
twentieth century; however, the breadth and depth of
Mexico’s conflict, its long duration, and its appearance on
multiple fronts – rural and urban, political and cultural,
economic and social – meant that Mexico for the first three
or four decades of the twentieth century was the Petri dish
for various socialist and communist experiments. Leftist
US journalist John Reed (1887–1920) began his career
traipsing after General Francisco (Pancho) Villa’s army in
the north of Mexico and describing for newspaper readers
at home the practical, commonsense, but quite radical
thinking that came to the surface as Villa attempted to
reorganize the conquered territory. Reed would go on to
write his most famous work on the Russian Revolution of
1917, an event that truly “shook the world,” as he said, and
one that was far more intellectually, strategically and
politically mapped out than Mexico’s “insurgency.” For
the latter, socialism was a set of practical, seat-of-the-pants
377strategies for overcoming the gross inequalities wrought by
years of capitalist and rural feudalist domination. Villa’s
army expropriated the large estates of northern Mexico and
replaced them with collectively organized, communally
run farms, where workers who had never heard of Karl
Marx, the Paris Commune, Vladimir Lenin, or the concept
of the revolutionary party set about imposing an equal
distribution of wealth. In other rural areas, Indian farmers
joined the revolution to restore their titles to the communal
agrarian ejidos that had predominated in rural Mexico, as
in much of the world, in the pre-modern era. Although
Frederick Engels wrote extensively about the system of
primitive communism the ejido resembled, certainly none
of the campesinos (peasants) had heard of him or his
books, nor did they see their struggle to reclaim their
ejidos as part of a worldwide struggle between private and
communal ownership.
Finally, there were in Mexico astute and committed
socialists and communists, most of whom came together in
the “Red Battalions,” organized military units of
anarchosyndicalist trade unionists that fought through
strikes, demonstrations, and on the battlefield to build a
society run by and serving the interests of the working
class. Agitators in both rural and urban Mexico rallied the
masses, joined the Communist International, and adhered
to the (often changing) ideological principles emanating
from abroad. Thus, both consciously and unconsciously,
the conflagration in Mexico drew from and fed into the
international socialist conflict that gripped the world in the
early twentieth century.
José Carlos Mariátegui
378Probably the foremost socialist political thinker in Latin
America of this era was Peruvian essayist José Carlos
Mariátegui (1894–1930). Converted to socialism after a
trip to Europe in 1919, where he married an Italian
woman, Mariátegui convened a salon in his house in Lima
that drew together avant-garde artists and writers to
discuss and debate the main intellectual ideas of the times.
Mariátegui’s influential work, Seven Interpretive Essays
on Peruvian Reality, marked him as the father of Latin
American Marxism and one of the main political architects
of the particular place of socialist thought in the context of
Latin America. Self-schooled, since his poor background
had only allowed him a primary school education, but well
versed in literature, poetry, and the arts, Mariátegui carved
out an eclectic Marxism that incorporated spiritualist
egalitarianism with materialist economic equality,
anti-authoritarianism and anti-dogmatism with an
adherence to socialist principles into a single doctrine.
Although he died very young (the cumulative effect of a
life of disability resulting from a childhood disease that his
impoverished state had left untreated), Mariátegui stands
as one of the key figures in the early twentieth-century
debate over socialism. His special contribution was the
singular task of fitting Marxism into the sharply divergent
and underdeveloped Latin American reality. He predicted
in 1923 that the economic hardships facing Latin America
would give rise to proletarian revolution:
In this great contemporary crisis, the proletariat is not a
spectator; it is an actor. In it the fate of the world
proletariat is to be resolved. From it will emerge –
according to all odds and predictions – the proletarian
civilization, the socialist civilization, destined to succeed
379the declining, decadent, moribund capitalist, individualist,
and bourgeois civilization... We are witnessing the
disintegration, the agony of a worn-out, senile, decrepit
society, and at the same time, we are witnessing the slow
and restless gestation, the formation, the creation, of the
new society.4
Conclusion
The advent of socialism, an ideology born in Europe but
adapted to the reality of poor societies in Asia, Latin
America, and Africa with varying degrees of success,
distinguished the twentieth century from those that came
before it. With the triumph of the Russian Revolution in
1917, previously dispersed leftist parties and movements
representing labor, agrarian reform, and political and
human rights were called on to join into a unified left. By
the end of the 1920s, every country of Latin America
sported a communist party. Socialist, anarchist and various
strains of leftist parties remained active and captured the
allegiance of thousands of individuals. While the
organized left commanded widespread following among
the trade unions, it was in the arena of the arts where Latin
Americans began to make their mark. From the Mexican
muralists to Brazilian artists, from the writings of essayists
such as Mariátegui to the reflective poetry of Gabriela
Mistral, the ideology of socialism reached out to the
masses.
Nevertheless, debate between left and right continued to
permeate the political and economic life in the inter-war
years. The rise of fascism as a powerful force in Europe,
seeking to destroy the left and to take all democracy with
380it, influenced Latin America’s emerging cadre of socialist
and populist leaders. Populist leaders sought to hew a
middle ground, hoping to win over the leftist working class
while appeasing members of the expanding middle class.
3819
Populism and the Struggle for Change
Quite likely, Mariátegui and other Marxists at the time
underestimated not only the rapid rise of the US to
pre-eminence in the hemisphere, but likewise the extent to
which the northern power would derail attempts at socialist
transformation in Latin America. If the twentieth century
was the era in which socialism appeared on the world stage
with dramatic and earthshaking effect, it was also the
“American century”; the era in which the United States
became the foremost world power (Figure 9.1).
The trajectory is well known. The United States emerged
from World War I as the equal to Britain and in contention
with its former colonial master for trade and investment. It
surfaced as the unquestioned world capitalist power after
World War II, remaining locked in conflict with the
communist bloc in the Soviet Union and China for much
of the rest of the century. Finally, by the dawn of the
twenty-first century, and despite the looming power of
China, whose brand of communism was appearing more
capitalist by the day, the “West” (the euphemism for
capitalist Europe and the United States, but not including
Latin America, despite the reality of geography) emerged
triumphant over the dismantled communist experiment in
Eastern Europe and in a position to dictate harsh economic
and political terms, at least for a while, on much of the rest
of the so-called “developing world.” It was not socialism,
however, that rose to prominence in the large economies of
382Latin America. Populism, revolving around a number of
key figures, dominated the era.
Recognition that workers had legitimate demands served
as the platform upon which well-known populist political
figures built their support in the mid-twentieth century:
Getúlio Vargas (1883–1954) in Brazil from 1930 until the
mid-1950s; Juan Domingo Perón (1895–1974), who
dominated Argentine politics from the late 1940s to the
1950s, and whose legacy has remained influential ever
since; and Lázaro Cárdenas (1895–1970), whose 1934–40
presidency implemented the policies of the Mexican
Revolution more than any leader before that time or since.
Neither Peru’s Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre (1895–1979)
nor Colombia’s Jorge Eliécer Gaitán ever reached the
presidency of their respective countries, but both left an
indelible imprint on succeeding decades of politics. Haya
was the founder of the populist APRA party (Alianza
Popular Revolucionario Americana), which produced an
influential populist movement in Peru, while Gaitán
commanded a broad following among Colombia’s popular
classes in the 1930s and 1940s until his assassination in
1948. Each of these men figured prominently in political
events, left important legacies in whatever political
configurations succeeded them, and inalterably influenced
the social and cultural landscape, as well as the
governments, of their respective countries.
Figure 9.1 By the terms of the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty of
1901 Great Britain ceded to the United States the right to
build a canal through the Isthmus of Panama and
recognized the latter’s pre-eminence in the region. In this
cartoon, Homer Davenport shows Uncle Sam and John
383Bull dividing a world in which Latin America is not even
pictured, demonstrating the way the great powers made
decisions with no concern for the leaders or people of the
countries concerned.
Although we refer to them as “populists,” that admittedly
imprecise label could have been applied to some caudillos
mentioned in earlier chapters. This twentieth-century brand
384of populism differed from the nineteenth-century variety in
several important ways. First, it emerged from, and in
many ways intersected with, the activist working-class,
socialist, and social democratic mass movements described
in this chapter. Secondly, while none of these populist
leaders were leftists, nor traced their origins to the trade
union or socialist movements, they drew on the tactics,
honed the rhetoric, and saw the labor movement as a
critical social force. Their populist influence relied on a
mass base that had been forged in the battle for workers’
rights; matured under the tutelage of socialist, anarchist, or
communist leaders; and relied on the organizational
apparatus of left-leaning political parties.
As a political force, populism can move to the left or to the
right. Historically it has been the foundation more for
fascism than communism, especially in the twentieth
century; but its appeal to the masses rests precisely on the
promise of redressing the grievances of the dispossessed,
disenfranchised, ignored, and downtrodden. Unlike
Marxist socialism, however, populism makes no
fundamental critique of capitalism nor does it advocate
worker control of the means of production or a worker-run
state. Instead populists use the strength of the state, in the
hands of capitalists, as a patronage machine to appease
workers and meet the demands of mass movements. At
different times both Perón and Vargas voiced their
admiration for Italian fascism, and both used the repressive
arm of the state to silence their critics; but they also rebuilt
labor movements and parties as their base of support. In
return for the protection and recognition of the state, the
working class offered support. In a brief comparison
between Latin America and the fascist regimes of
385Germany, Italy, and Spain, historian Eric Hobsbawm
remarked: “European fascist regimes destroyed labour
movements, the Latin American leaders they inspired
created them. Whatever the intellectual filiation,
historically, we cannot speak of the same kind of
movement.”1
Getúlio Vargas and “New State” Politics
Getúlio Vargas was a 47-year-old rancher who traded on
influence and political cunning to win the governorship of
Brazil’s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, in 1928.
Two years later he made a bid for the presidency, losing
narrowly to Julio Prestes, in what was considered a
fraudulent election. Refusing to accept the results, Vargas,
along with many of the tenentes from the failed military
uprisings of the 1920s, toppled the Republic and installed a
new one. The military coup that placed Vargas at the helm
of the government ended the First, or Old, Republic
(1889–1930), introduced a new phase in Brazilian politics,
and marked the decisive entrance of previously silent and
marginal groups into the political equation. Getúlio Vargas
moved to centralize power in the hands of the federal
government, and in so doing angered many governors and
state and local powerbrokers. He established new
“presidents” in the states, bypassing elected officials
everywhere except Minas Gerais, where the elected
governor was allowed to continue. Vargas wrapped his
authoritarian measures in national, and often nationalistic,
terms, reflecting the impact of the world economic
depression and the rise of fascism abroad. Eventually
Getúlio Vargas nationalized rail and sea transportation and
established a number of state-owned firms including
386Petrobras, the national oil industry, Chembras, the national
chemical industry, and others.
Borrowing a page from Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal,
Vargas increased the scope, size, and importance of the
federal bureaucracy. He gained considerable support from
organized labor – after making sure that anyone who
opposed him was eliminated. The government initiated
construction on some of the long-promised workers’
housing in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Opened with
much publicity and fanfare, Vargas took credit for finally
completing a promise that had been held out to the urban
masses since the urban renewal of the early twentieth
century. However, official propaganda failed to mention
that the new housing was far from adequate to meet the
needs of the growing urban population, was doled out as
favors to unions for distribution among their most loyal
members, and was never extended to the poorest regions of
the country. Other improvements such as electrification, a
national steel industry, expansion in public health services,
more schools and better education also reached only urban
dwellers.
Vargas’s ideological convictions are hard to pin down.
Although he operated in ways that promoted Brazil’s
national interests, he was quick to suppress any social
force that disagreed with him. In 1930 he made overtures
to the hero of the Tenentes uprising, Luís Carlos Prestes,
offering him a position as head of the military, but Prestes
refused, opting instead for the Brazilian Communist Party
(PCB). Formed less than ten years earlier, the PCB already
had a substantial following among urban intellectuals and
the labor movement, but a communist-led revolt in
387November 1935 was immediately and severely repressed.
Vargas suspended civil rights, jailed opposition trade
unionists, and strengthened police powers. He
opportunistically used a rumor of a communist uprising on
November 10, 1937 to stage a coup d’état and launch his
corporatist Estado Novo, or “New State,” which lasted for
the next seven years. The Estado Novo curtailed states’
rights, banned strikes and lockouts, and centralized
decision making in the hands of the all-powerful executive.
To avert class conflicts, Vargas promised something for
both workers and employers, incorporating them into
sindicatos, or state-regulated interest groups. In this way,
the president was able to establish a pattern of leadership
that claimed to place national interest above regional or
class-based interests. Labor and political historian Barbara
Weinstein points out that what Vargas actually did was
join the interests of the industrialists with the state and
manage them as one. The Estado Novo borrowed elements
from European fascism current at that time. Unlike
Mussolini and Hitler, however, Vargas did not build his
base in a new political party, relying instead on the
military to back him, until 1945. Moreover, rather than
crush the workers’ movement, as had occurred in Europe,
Vargas organized the Brazilian Labor Party, incorporating
only the trade unions and their leaders who had benefited
from his policies into his base of support.
The army and members of the industrial elite grew fearful
that Vargas was planning to usurp all power into his own
hands, and moved to depose him on October 29, 1945. He
retreated to his estate and private life in Rio Grande do Sul
until 1950 when he returned to politics, ran for President,
388and was elected by a wide margin. The political and
economic scene of the 1950s was not, however, conducive
to rebuilding and sustaining either Vargas’s own personal
popularity or his ultra-nationalist program, with or without
working-class support. Congress was divided and much of
it opposed to him; inflation was out of hand; and a newly
powerful North American business community was
strong-arming its way into Brazilian industry and investing
on its own terms. Corruption, graft, infighting, and
criminal activity characterized nearly all branches of the
government. Confronted with a military demand that he
resign, Vargas took his own life on August 24, 1954,
leaving behind a suicide note blaming “outside powers,”
clearly referring to US interference in Brazilian affairs. In
his death note Vargas attempted to depict his suicide as a
necessary step to maintain Brazilian integrity and
sovereignty in the face of outside pressures. The real story,
as we have seen, was more complicated, especially when
the entire record of corruption, political repression, and
favoritism that marred the Vargas era is brought into the
equation.
Juan Perón and Peronism
The best known of Latin America’s populist leaders, and
one whose legacy has endured for generations, was
undoubtedly Juan Domingo Perón. The phenomenon
known as “Peronism” grew out of the failure of repeated
attempts by Yrigoyen to establish a middle-class-based
political system from 1916 to 1930 – mainly because his
UCR had neither the will nor the means to effectively
oppose the dominance of the oligarchy. In January 1919,
police response to a factory owner’s request to break up a
389metalworkers’ strike and demonstration soon escalated
into a street melee and subsequent three-daylong battle.
Right-wing youths from neighborhoods throughout the
city, and even from surrounding towns, converged on the
city’s Jewish neighborhoods, blaming immigrant Jewish
shopkeepers for labor agitation. The police looked on
while hundreds of the immigrant poor were
indiscriminately attacked and killed. By week’s end 1,500
people were reported dead and over 4,000 wounded,
earning the week the name Semana Trágica (Tragic
Week). Despite this blot on his record, and accusations of
incompetence, Yrigoyen managed another term in office
before he was overthrown in 1930 by a military coup,
followed by a number of military regimes interspersed
with civilian governments. The importance of this period
lies not in the names of these governments, nor even the
circumstances that surround each of the coups and returns
to elections, but rather in the recognition that by the 1930s
Argentina had reached an entirely new stage. Ineffective as
a mediator between the oligarchy and the workers, tending
generally to side with the former over the latter, the UCR
and Yrigoyen’s middleclass leadership moved to the back
seat. The new military junta demonstrated little inclination
to reverse this political process. However, one military
officer recognized that the industrial working class was not
necessarily an impediment, and could be mobilized to
serve as the basis for building a corporatist state that joined
the interests of labor with that of at least a large section of
the national bourgeoisie to promote a nationalist agenda.
That military officer was Juan Domingo Perón who, since
his first appearance on the political scene in 1943, exerted
a major influence over Argentine political life.
390From his position as Secretary of Labor in the government
that took power in 1943, Perón built a base of support
among trade unionists and the urban poor by calling for
increased pay, union recognition, and better working and
living conditions. As a result of his clever maneuverings,
he won the 1946 presidential elections and remained in
power until 1955, when he was ousted in a military coup.
Even in exile, Perón cast a long shadow over the next two
decades of Argentina’s politics. In 1973 he returned from
exile in Spain to serve again as president, but died the next
year. Perón’s tremendous influence stemmed from a
number of factors, including the popularity of his first
wife, Eva Duarte Perón (1919–52), who through the
Peronist-created Social Welfare Agency, and later the Eva
Perón Foundation, distributed clothing, money, housing,
and other benefits to the working poor. Snubbed by
fashionable society ladies, whom she called “las señoras
gordas” (the fat ladies), Eva Perón personally received
literally thousands of people in her marble monument. An
attractive young woman, she built a fanatically loyal
following by meeting with, listening to, and genuinely
helping people who had been all but ignored throughout
Argentine history (Figure 9.2).
Perón’s – or the Peróns’ – success relied on a combination
of factors. First, real reforms benefited working people.
Wages for industrial workers (not all workers, granted, but
for a sizeable, and very visible, core in industry) increased
by 53 percent between 1946 and 1949. In addition unions
won recognition, collective bargaining rights, protection
from capricious dismissal, and regulated hours, working
conditions, and vacation and sick time. Benefits and wages
were not uniformly high, and at times fell, but
391improvements on the job combined with a greater respect
for working people to boost Perón’s popularity. Secondly,
Peronism created a worker identity by building a sense of
community. The government used public relations tactics
designed to win adulation for Perón, including parades,
huge demonstrations, sporting events, beauty pageants, and
other contests, to create a perception of cohesion between
working-class and Peronist goals. Thirdly, Peronism
redefined the contours, and the tools, of the class struggle.
According to historian Daniel James, Juan Perón
effectively redirected workers’ previous political loyalties
as socialists, communists, and radicals toward allegiance
with him personally, his wife Evita, and the Peronist labor
party. By means of repression, Perón erased and
marginalized the leftist parties and organizations with
which the working class and poor had previously
identified, substituting a new identity for workers as
integral to, even the pride of, a new national, political
community. Finally, Peronism sought to build – perhaps
more rhetorically than actually – a “New Argentina” in
which Argentines could take pride. Perón’s nationalization
of the British rail system was greeted enthusiastically as a
source of national self-respect, despite dubious benefits to
the Argentine economy, since the system was not returning
much of a profit for the British. The latter, it has been
argued, were happy to be rid of it, since it was inefficiently
operated and in need of costly repairs. Careful
investigation has shown that many of the improvements
Peronism initiated were of short duration, lacked
sustainability, and owed more to graft than real reform, but
the image was quite the opposite. After only a few short
years in office, the slogan of the administration was
“Perón cumple!” (“Perón delivers!”).
392Figure 9.2 First Lady Eva Perón, in an elaborate haute
couture gown, and President Juan Perón at the Teatro
Colón, Buenos Aires, ca. 1950.
In general Perón expanded the franchise, thereby
dramatically widening his base of support among the poor,
workers, and women. People who before 1943 had been
locked out of the national decision-making process found
393themselves at its center. Perón boasted that he had made
possible the entrance of “more than 900,000 women” into
the paid workforce in all kinds of jobs and professions. “It
is our duty,” he argued, “to morally and materially dignify
their efforts.” Perón encouraged full voting rights for
women and the expansion of protective legislation. In 1949
he formed a new wing within his own party, the Peronist
Feminist Party, under the leadership of Eva Perón,
proclaiming that: “The Peronist Feminist Party opens its
doors to all women of the people, and especially to the
humble women who have been forgotten by the poets and
by the politicians.” (He also founded a “Men’s Party”
branch, as well as a branch for “Workers.”). Interestingly,
in its founding platform the women’s branch included a
quote from Eva Perón stating that women need their own
branch because “just as only workers could wage their own
struggle for liberation, so too could only women be the
salvation of women.” Yet Evita always positioned herself
in an adoring relationship with her husband, repeating
often that he completed her and that she was only fulfilled
through him. The 1951 election was dramatically different
from any before or since, and nearly unparalleled in the
world: 90 percent of Argentine women voted, compared
with 86 percent of men. Not only did women vote heavily
for Perón, but, true to Eva’s point, they also voted for
themselves: seven women were elected to the Senate and
24 to the House of Deputies.
Perón’s Fall from Grace
Argentina’s economic honeymoon, which had allowed for
the expansion of worker benefits and other social
expenditures, drew to a close in the early 1950s as the
394world economy underwent a harsh correction and
Argentina’s agricultural exports met increasing
competition from other countries. In 1951 Perón attempted
to restore his standing through the bold move of placing
Eva on the ticket as vice-president, but this was vetoed
immediately by the military, which had no interest in
seeing the Peróns consolidate their power so decisively.
The military and their supporters in the oligarchy, who
hated both Juan and Eva Perón, were undoubtedly relieved
when Eva died of cancer on July 26, 1952. Not only did
her death at 33 cut short any plans the couple might have
had to extend their power but, along with the economic
downtown, it hastened the end of Juan Perón’s popularity.
Before the economic doldrums set in completely, however,
the country confronted the full impact of Eva Perón’s
death: “The entire city and the entire country instantly
went into the deepest, most heartfelt state of mourning.
Cinemas stopped their movies, theaters interrupted their
plays, restaurants and bars immediately showed customers
to the door, their shutters slamming down over suddenly
darkened street fronts. Within a matter of minutes the city
was silent and dark.”2 The government suspended all
operations for two days and many labor unions, especially
those that Eva Perón had most supported, ordered their
members to attend the wake and funeral. Thousands of
people passed by her well-embalmed body for the two
weeks it remained on view to the public. Over a million
people crowded the streets to watch the mile-long funeral
procession, headed by Perón, government officials, and
members of the Peronist Feminist Party. Eva’s supporters
began a campaign to nominate her for sainthood in the
Catholic Church, while her husband drew up plans for a
395mausoleum three times taller than the Statue of Liberty,
where he intended to keep her body on display forever.
Neither of these grandiose projects came to pass. If
Perón’s popularity had benefited from his wife’s work, her
premature death contributed to his fall from grace. The
military launched a coup in 1955, forcing Perón into exile
in Paraguay and then Europe. Until his return to Argentina
in the 1970s Perón lived in Madrid, where he passed much
of his time in the very apolitical job of entertaining himself
with María Estela (Isabel) Martínez de Perón (b. 1931), a
young nightclub entertainer he met and married in Panama
during the early years of his exile. Isabel Perón returned
with him to Argentina in the early 1970s and was able to
do what Evita could not: run for the vice-presidency and
assume the presidency upon her husband’s death in 1974.
Politics Engendered
Although Eva Duarte and Isabel Martínez were significant
female participants in Latin American political life, they
were simply two individuals who came into the national
limelight as a result of extraordinary circumstances, and
cannot be considered representative of widespread changes
in the role of women in the twentieth century. There were,
however, other women whose roles were of more
significance, and the era itself witnessed major changes in
women’s lives. Historian Susan Besse notes that the
characteristics of the early twentieth century influenced the
form of female participation in society at large and in
movements for emancipation. Economic development,
industrialization, and urban expansion provided more
opportunities for women’s work outside the home in
396factories, transportation, and communication sectors and in
the offices of the growing civil and private bureaucracy.
Members of avant-garde social movements called into
question the role of women in society and heralded the
newfound freedom of artistic and cultural expression for
and by women pioneered in European capitals and
spreading to the cities of the Americas. The rise of radio,
movies, and print media, especially magazines and
newspapers devoted to the discussion of women’s goals,
aspirations, and lifestyles, connected women with each
other and brought to the foreground their role in society.
Although hardly welcomed in conservative or religious
circles, suffrage as a basic female right, and women’s
struggle to achieve it, reverberated through the urban
middle and upper classes in many Latin American nations.
Argentina hosted the First International Women’s
Congress in 1910; subsequent conferences were held in
several Latin American countries through the 1920s. These
meetings drew together mostly elite women from
professions such as medicine, law, academia, and science,
as well as those who used their positions as the wives of
powerful men to promote educational, welfare, and social
reform, and finally, a small group of social activists
associated with socialist and other left-wing organizations
(see Box 9.1). The majority of poor and laboring women
from cities and the countryside, factory workers, maids,
seamstresses, prostitutes, street vendors, shop and office
clerks, did not attend and were probably unaware of – the
women’s congresses that met over the next few decades. In
Latin America, as in Europe and the United States, the
campaign for women’s suffrage garnered mass media
attention; however, most people in Latin America,
397regardless of gender, were disenfranchised by virtue of
their illiteracy, poverty, and race. For example, Ecuador
extended the vote to women in 1929, but the race, class,
and language restrictions prevented the vast majority in
this nation of indigenous people from voting. Women won
the right to vote in Brazil and Uruguay in 1932; in Cuba,
Bolivia, and El Salvador in the 1930s; in Panama and the
Dominican Republic in the years before World War II; and
in the rest of Latin America in the decades afterward. Their
inability to participate as full citizens by no means placed
them in an exceptional position when compared to poor
and illiterate men, since most people were barred from the
exercise of their rights in societies dominated by men of
European extraction.
Box 9.1 Bertha Lutz and women’s suffrage
In Brazil, Bertha Lutz (1894–1976), the daughter
of a Swiss-Brazilian father and an English mother,
was the moving force behind the movement to win
women the right to vote. An exceptional woman,
educated in Brazil and France, Lutz used her
training as a lawyer to argue for greater rights for
women through the organization she founded in
1922: the Brazilian Federation for Feminine
Progress, an affiliate of the International Women’s
Suffrage Alliance. The signing of the 1932 civil
code that granted women the franchise was, in
Lutz’s view, only the beginning of a long campaign
to win equal rights. Elected to the Chamber of
398Deputies in the 1930s, Lutz was instrumental in
pushing for legislation that granted women full
social and legal rights, until women and men both
lost their political rights when Getúlio Vargas
assumed dictatorial powers in 1937.
Despite restrictions on political participation, women in
urban areas began to assume a new role in society. Modern
styles hit the major cities, and advertisements appeared in
newspapers and glossy magazines using women’s images
to sell products, many of which were directed at a new,
exclusively female market. Women who were earning
money for the first time, even on a limited basis – working
in retail stores, government agencies, and factories – had
money to spend on cosmetics, clothes, and entertainment.
In major cities such as Buenos Aires, Havana, Mexico
City, Lima, São Paulo, Rio, and other metropolitan areas
of Latin America, women came to be seen as consumers,
arbiters of culture, and members of the educated society at
large. No longer under the strict control of fathers and
husbands and now visible in the public sphere, women
nonetheless still operated largely under the confinements
of home, motherhood, and second-class status in the
workplace, or under conditions which Besse calls
“restructured patriarchy.”3
This new trend had its detractors. A powerful right-wing
movement feared that newly enfranchised women would
bring about the destruction of society. Conservatives in the
Catholic Church expressed fears that women were
399abandoning their roles as mothers and housewives, and, in
their view, pushing society to the brink of anarchy. Social
change was threatening the traditional order that had
ensconced men firmly as heads of household. Some men
felt uneasy with the knowledge that women were no longer
dependent on them for their livelihood, could now
influence the political process with their votes, and could
begin to make decisions for themselves. Urban men and
women (the innovations rarely reached remote, rural areas)
were confronting fundamental changes in one of the most
basic institutions of society: the family, and its traditional
power relationships. It was not simply the lives of women
that were being tranformed, but the entire gender balance
of society, or the many ways men and women thought of
themselves and sought to live their lives as individuals and
as couples.
Revolutionizing Mexico: Lázaro Cárdenas
Whereas both Perón and Vargas drew support from newly
enfranchised women, Mexico’s revolutionary leaders, with
the exception of the communists, clung to patriarchal
privilege and refused to consider extending the vote to
women – despite the latter’s extensive participation in the
Revolution and widespread support for social reform. In
line with Comintern positions, the Mexican Communist
Party (PCM) supported women’s suffrage, seeing it as a
basic democratic right; the Party also foresaw the
important role women could play in the impending
struggle against fascism. According to historian Jocelyn
Olcott, in 1935 the PCM linked these issues in the slogan:
“Ample democratic liberties; women’s suffrage;
dissolution of the ‘Dorados’ and ‘guardias blancas’” (the
400latter refer to fascist organizations in Mexico).4
Fearing
that women’s votes would represent a conservative bloc in
favor of the Church (a not entirely unfounded suspicion),
the government withheld the franchise from women until
1953. In other ways a populist like Perón and Vargas,
Mexican president Lázaro Cárdenas did not promote
women’s rights. His six-year term in office (1934–40) is
remembered for reforms in labor, education, and social
programs, but not women’s rights. He was an architect of
the artistic and cultural explosion associated with the
postrevolution era, bringing to fruition many goals of the
Revolution and concretizing the abstract language of the
1917 Constitution into a defined political program. Since
his term coincided with the decade in which the advanced
capitalist countries were enduring the Great Depression,
Cárdenas was able to plot a more independent and
self-sufficient course than might have been possible if the
interventionist US state had been monitoring political and
economic developments in Mexico more closely. Concern
about the rise of fascism in Europe also helped keep events
in Mexico below the US radar – even when Cárdenas
nationalized British- and American-owned oil companies.
The formation of Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) in 1938
sent shivers down the collective financial spines of
European and US businessmen, but Cárdenas appeased
corporate and government interests by offering
compensation and assurances that there would be no
further expropriations of foreign companies.
Cárdenas’s 1934 Agrarian Code called for the confiscation
of 45 million acres of private land and its redistribution
into ejidos, a reform more extensive than those of all his
predecessors put together. To service the ejidos and sustain
401the livelihood of the peasantry who maintained them,
Cárdenas instituted rural schools. The latter were to serve
not only as a means of educating rural children, but also of
propagating the core values of the revolutionary program:
national pride, class-consciousness, and distrust of the
Church. When faced with strong opposition from devout
Catholics and organized resistance from the hierarchy,
Cárdenas relaxed some of the most anti-clerical programs,
allowing the Church to play a role in delivering state
services, especially education. Cárdenas faced opposition
among pro-Catholic, right-wing, and pro-fascist interests
in Mexico, but managed to ride out the storm during the
final years of his presidency, aided by his support of the
Allied forces in the face of the war, which by 1940 was
engulfing much of the world. For rural and urban workers
who benefited from progressive labor laws, land reforms,
and curbs on the authority of hacendados, mine owners,
and industrialists, Cárdenas embodied the Mexican
Revolution and stood as the guardian of its ideals.
Populism in Colombia and Peru
Two other names generally crop up in discussions of
charismatic Latin American populists: Víctor Raúl Haya
de la Torre (1895–1979) in Peru and Jorge Eliécer Gaitán
(1903–48) in Colombia. Neither commanded a fraction of
the power nor left a legacy as enduring as Vargas and
Perón, nor did they play a role in shaping the contours of a
new revolutionary state, like Cárdenas. However, both
Gaitán and Haya de la Torre carved out a particular niche
in the politics of Colombia and Peru, respectively, and
served as models of modern-day political leaders in an era
402when revolutionary politics, Marxism, and cross-class
populism held sway in many Latin American countries.
Jorge Eliécer Gaitán
Because Gaitán’s career was cut short when he was
assassinated in downtown Bogotá in 1948, there has long
been considerable speculation as to what he actually did
accomplish, and what he might have accomplished had he
risen to the high political office to which he aspired. Born
of struggling but respectable middle-class parents, Gaitán
worked his way into elite political circles, while always
bridging the gap between the middle and lower classes.
His particular genius was in connecting his progressive
political values with the aspirations of the poor by putting
into common language and concrete goals the road to
change. Gaitán’s writing made him something of a
latter-day Thomas Paine, making socialism “common
sense”; and he was a charismatic public speaker.
Moreover, he was tireless, if idiosyncratic, in his approach.
After differing with the leaders of Colombia’s Liberal
Party – in part because of what he saw as its tepid response
to the 1928 banana massacre in Ciénaga – he split off to
form his own party. Based on the platform of this party,
the Unión Nacional Izquierdista Revolucionaria (UNIR,
National Leftist Revolution Union) Gaitán built a
following that led him to the brink of taking control of the
old Liberal Party and ascending to the presidency in 1950.
To the shock of his supporters and adversaries alike, two
years before the election Gaitán was killed on the street
outside his Bogotá law office. The motive for his death
remains a mystery because a mob immediately
403apprehended and killed his assassin, Juan Roa Sierra.
Subsequent to the assassination, rioting broke out in
Bogotá with devoted and disappointed followers
rampaging through the city in a mass riot that became
known as the Bogotazo. The exact nature of the crowds’
frustrations was not entirely clear, except to indicate that
much was expected of Gaitán. He had raised the hopes of
the popular classes by attaching his own vision for a more
just and prosperous Colombia with the aspirations and
goals of a wide swath of his countrymen and -women.
Although not a socialist, he used the language of socialism
to advocate for a more humane capitalism in which the
government intervened to ensure an equitable distribution
of wealth, public education, a decent standard of living,
and that the benefits of modern society were available to
everyone. Unlike Perón and Vargas, Gaitán left a legacy of
what might have been. His role in government (where he
was not a steady presence, moving in and out of various
political offices) is usually discussed in terms of what he
advocated, what he intended, and what his policies might
have produced in the long term. These imprecise legends,
similar to those surrounding Pancho Villa, are surprisingly
important aspects of history, as are the myths surrounding
what should have, or could have, transpired, but never did.
What happened instead was in many ways
incomprehensible: near breakdown of civil society. The
Bogotazo spread from the capital to other cities and to the
countryside; from a few weeks of rioting it turned into 30
years of warfare. Known as La Violencia, the battle
initially pitted Liberal against Conservative, but later
expanded beyond the bounds of mere political rivalry. The
term La Violencia is indicative. It was the form, the
404violence, that was remembered, not the grievances, the
parties involved, or even the outcome. In brief, riots in
Bogotá led to peasant land seizures in rural areas,
precipitating in turn severe repression from landowners,
who rejected peasant claims and hired thugs to expel them
from seized properties. The peasants formed guerrilla
armies, which went to war against the hacendados’
personal armies, turning Colombia’s countryside into a
battlefield. The Violence ended in 1957 when Liberals and
Conservatives signed a pact promising to divide political
power by sharing some of the key components of
governance in a national unity structure. The National
Front maintained the peace from 1957 until 1970, but did
little to further democracy. By the early 1970s guerrilla
warfare had broken out in opposition to the undemocratic
government, plummeting Colombia back into a period of
violence from which it has never fully emerged. Jorge
Gaitán’s promise to forge a representative government that
would incorporate the majority of Colombians into the
decision-making process was never to be. The reassertion
of regional rivalries and repressive military solutions to the
escalating violence in recent decades, accelerated by the
emergence of powerful drug traffickers engaged in refining
coca and marketing cocaine, have drowned out the populist
vision of the 1940s and 1950s.
Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre and the APRA
During the pre-colonial and colonial periods Peru was a
country rich in resources including silver and gold; an
enterprising, hardworking, and dense population;
magnificent cities and architecture; and a system of
centralized government and towns connected by a vast
405road network. At the same time, Peru has always been a
study in contrasts. Geographically dispersed over an
immense area and rugged terrain, the Peruvian people are
sharply divided between the rich and powerful and the
desperately poor, living in isolated hamlets or crowded
urban squalor. A sizeable, educated middle class has
infrequently held the reins of government since
independence from Spain in 1824. More often, power in
Peru has passed back and forth between military and
civilian rule, neither of which has managed to improve the
lives of the millions of mainly indigenous people who live
in grinding poverty.
The career of Peruvian politician Víctor Raúl Haya de la
Torre was emblematic of the coalescence of socialist and
nationalist ideals played out in the Latin American context.
Haya, a student leader in Cuzco who was influenced by
Peruvian Marxist Mariátegui, in 1924 founded the Popular
Revolutionary Alliance of America, with a program calling
for progressive change along the socialist lines that were
influential among nationalist and radical political groups
throughout Latin America. In subsequent decades Haya’s
politics followed a more populist, nationalist course,
rejecting communism and attempting to forge an
APRA-based victory in the electoral arena. Haya himself
did not win electoral office until very late in his career –
and then only on a populist program that was a mere
shadow of earlier Aprista nationalism – but APRA
remained a symbol of Latin American attempts to win
national autonomy. Moreover, it stood as an ideal for
civilian rule in a society that, except for brief intervals, had
languished under the shadow of authoritarian and military
governments.
406Central America
In other places, particularly Central America, nationalist
politicians shifted from forging popular unity to mounting
armed resistance to US control. Ideologically these
movements and their leaders spanned the political
spectrum: from populist nationalism, exemplified by
Augusto César Sandino in Nicaragua, to embracing
communist insurrection, as seen in the program of
Salvadoran labor leader Augustín Farabundo Martí. These
two Central American revolutionaries, whose lives closely
paralleled each other (Farabundo Martí worked with
Sandino for a while in Nicaragua despite their political
differences, and they both died at the hands of their
respective governments at just 39 years of age), set the
stage for important insurrectionary movements in the
1970s and 1980s. Finally, Costa Rica’s history stands apart
from its neighbors in both Central and South America. A
country that has democratically elected its leadership every
four years for most of the century and abolished its army in
the late 1940s, Costa Rica has one of the highest standards
of living in the hemisphere. This coffee-producing nation
presents an interesting contrast to Colombia, a country
similarly based on the growth and export of coffee, and
where Liberal and Conservative parties have long
competed for power. But while Costa Rica has chosen
leaders through the ballot box, Colombia has endured
decades of political violence.
El Salvador
El Salvador emerged from the independence era in the
early 1820s with a deeply entrenched latifundio system in
407the hands of a small group referred to as the “Fourteen
families.” This tightly knit oligarchy, interconnected
through marriage, acted as a clan that protected its wealth
at all costs and shared little power, even with outside
investors. Unlike neighboring Guatemala, El Salvador’s
export economy did not generate a middle-class
bureaucracy in the service of foreign corporations or
domestic infrastructure until the twentieth century, when it
developed a professional and commercial class whose
prosperity and livelihood demanded its allegiance to the
ruling stratum. The Salvadoran oligarchy stood as a
bulwark against reform of any kind, and was quick to act
against even the merest whispers of unionization, universal
suffrage, or any involvement of the masses in the direction
of the government or public life. The Fourteen Families
ruled the entire country as if it was their personal fiefdom,
and controlled the workings of society to such an extent
that even US diplomatic envoys routinely referred to them
as the “feudal families.” The peasantry and working class
endured conditions of extreme poverty, scratching out an
existence on tiny plots of land or at minimal wages.
The main struggle for power occurred in 1932, when a
budding reform movement coalesced around the leadership
of Augustín Farabundo Martí (1893–1932), the Marxist
advocate of agrarian reform and universal suffrage. In spite
of his admiration for Leon Trotsky, the Bolshevik
revolutionary, which he probably picked up during his
years in Mexico (after his expulsion from Russia Trotsky
lived, and was eventually killed by Stalin’s agents, in
Mexico), Farabundo Martí transformed El Salvador’s
Socialist Party into a Moscow-oriented communist party in
1930 and assumed the position of Secretary-General. Two
408years later, in response to a military coup d’état that
overthrew elected president Arturo Araújo and installed
General Hernández Martínez as dictator, Salvadoran
communists organized a peasant and worker revolt against
the government. Scheduled for January 22, 1932, the
uprising was discovered before the date, thwarted, and the
leadership was apprehended and killed, including
Farabundo Martí. The subsequent violent repression,
during which the army rounded up an estimated
20,000–30,000 peasants for mass execution – many of
whom had no connection to the revolt – is referred to as La
Matanza (the Massacre). It stands as a moment in
Salvadoran history in which the landed oligarchy no longer
even pretended to govern, instead turning over political
power to the military, which ruled with an iron fist until
the early 1980s. At that time, the insurgency bearing
Martí’s name, the Farabundo Martí National Liberation
Front (FMLN), surfaced to lead a concerted war against
the dictatorial government.
Nicaragua
Nicaragua’s history and the efforts of Augusto César
Sandino (1895–1934) differed from El Salvador in that the
opposition movement that emerged in the 1920s was not
motivated by communist ideology, nor was it directed
solely against a homegrown, domestic oligarchy. Although
the US government strongly backed the Salvadoran
dictatorship, and continued to do so throughout the 1980s
guerrilla movement, there was no direct military
intervention, beyond advisors. In Nicaragua, however,
except for a few short intervals, US Marines occupied the
country for 22 years from 1911 to 1933, while the US
409government, working at the behest of US interests
controlling fruit and coffee production and exports, closely
supervised domestic political affairs through an alliance
with the Somoza family dynasty that ruled the country
from the time the Marines withdrew.
The United States gained a foothold in Nicaragua under
the government of José Santos Zelaya (1853–1919), who
came to the presidency in 1893 through a military coup.
Zelaya was a modernizer who oversaw the construction of
roads, port facilities, and railroads, the separation of
Church and state, and the initiation of public education.
Similar to Porfírio Díaz in Mexico, Zelaya encouraged
foreign investment and granted lucrative concessions to
US companies doing business in Nicaragua, to the degree
that by 1909 they controlled the production of coffee, gold,
lumber, and bananas. Concerned that US firms were
attempting to exert undue influence on domestic affairs,
and hopeful that European investors might render higher
profits for the national treasury and the pockets of its
powerful and wealthy citizens, the Nicaraguan government
invited competitors to bid on a canal across the isthmus. In
response, the US government ordered Marines into
Nicaragua. Under US pressure, Zelaya resigned in 1910,
putting an end to any hope for Nicaragua’s autonomous
development for more than a half-century. The opposition
Conservative Party installed Adolfo Díaz as President, his
only qualifications for the job being his employment as a
bookkeeper for an American mining company. Diaz’s
major accomplishment was to accept loans from the New
York banking firm of Brown Brothers and Seligman,
offering as security a controlling interest in Nicaragua’s
national bank, state railways, and customs revenues. For
410more than two decades the US army intermittently
occupied Nicaragua, ruling through a series of puppet
governments, and exerting considerable influence over the
day-to-day workings of society.
Refusing to recognize the legitimacy of a national election
until the US army exited the country, Augusto César
Sandino, the mestizo son of a moderately prosperous
landowner inspired by the nationalist principles of
Mexico’s revolution, mobilized an army of several
thousand volunteers to drive out the American forces. Both
as a result of the damage inflicted by Sandino’s army and
because the economic downturn at home made military
exploits abroad unpopular, President Roosevelt withdrew
the bulk of the occupation force in February 1932. The US
left behind the National Guard it had trained, under the
leadership of Anastasio Somoza García (1896–1956), and
a government in the hands of a compliant president.
Shortly before the withdrawal of the entire military force,
the newly installed National Guard commander
apprehended Sandino after a meeting with President Juan
Bautista Sacasa (1874–1946) and had him executed, a feat
of which Somoza boasted in later years. By 1936 Somoza
García had consolidated his power and was in control of
both the military and civilian wings of the government,
ushering in a family dynasty that ruled the country directly
and indirectly until 1979, when the triumphant Sandinista
National Liberation Front (FSLN, or Frente Sandinista de
Liberación Nacional) drove the last member of the
dynasty, Anastasio Somoza Debayle (1925–1980) into
exile in Florida.
Costa Rica
411Costa Rica’s history differed markedly from that of its
Central American neighbors. In the nineteenth century
Costa Rica was one of the major coffee-producing
and-exporting countries of the Americas. Like other
countries in the region, Costa Rica’s economy was based
on one primary export, coffee, and the ruling elite
controlled most of the nation’s wealth. As occurred in
Guatemala, Minor Keith and the United Fruit Company
managed the sale of coffee and other agricultural exports,
the combined total of which accounted for virtually all
national revenue. Despite a scenario that paralleled the
political economy of other nations, privileged Costa
Ricans did not rely on the military to maintain power, but
worked out a system of passing control of the government
back and forth between the Liberal and Conservative
parties for most of the late nineteenth and into the
twentieth centuries. In 1948 a break in this pattern
occurred, and José Figueres assumed leadership of the
country with the support of a rebel army. Figueres held the
presidency for the next 18 months, as promised, and
stepped down. During his time in office Figueres
implemented a series of reforms that have remained in
place until the present, and helped to ensure a peaceful and
prosperous society. Most importantly, he abolished the
army, thereby eliminating the incentive for war and the
accumulation of arms and military “toys” that have
consumed the militaries (and budgets) of most Latin
American nations in the twentieth century. He nationalized
the banking system, implemented a property tax, limited
the presidency to one term, granted women the right to
vote, and instituted measures allowing for the democratic
transference of power from one politician and one party to
another.
412Because of a well-managed system of public education,
Costa Rica has a 96 percent literacy rate, comparable to the
United States, Canada, and Cuba; and a well-run national
health service that no doubt contributes to the country’s
high life expectancy, low infant mortality, and reduced
levels of communicable disease. How and why Costa Rica
has managed to establish a system that other Latin
American countries have not remains something of a
mystery. Some of the explanations often proffered are that
it has a very homogeneous population; the extent of
income inequalities have never been the same as other
nations in the hemisphere; and there has been no army for
a long period of time. Whatever the reasons, Costa Rica’s
social welfare system is better than that of any other in the
hemisphere except Canada.
The Long Twentieth Century
British historian Eric Hobsbawm refers to the 1930s as the
“Great Slump” and notes that the political, and even
psychological, cultural, and social, outlook of the world
underwent a profound change as a result of the chain of
events set in motion by the 1929 Wall Street stock market
crash. “The Great Slump confirmed intellectuals, activists
and ordinary citizens in the belief that something was
fundamentally wrong with the world they lived in.”5
Hobsbawm’s insight may be only partially true as regards
Latin America, since the great financial shock that
undermined the confidence of the major powers in
London, New York, Berlin, and Paris reverberated
differently in Latin America.
413Because the nineteenth-century economies of most nations
in the region were based on exporting one, or very few,
raw materials (coffee from Brazil, Colombia, and Central
America; copper and nitrates from Chile; tin from Bolivia;
meat and grains from Argentina), the sudden and severe
contraction of demand from the US and Europe, as the
Depression deepened, severely damaged the exporting
nations at the production end of the commodity chain.
Moreover, Latin America’s infrastructure, much of it
essential for transporting materials to ports and urban
markets, had been built with loans and through direct
investments from abroad. As Europe and the US demanded
servicing of the debt, the debtor nations found they could
not pay. Interaction with traditional trading partners in
Europe, especially Britain and Germany, halted or
underwent change; trade patterns shifted from transatlantic
to moving almost entirely north to south and back again.
At the height of the Depression, in the mid-1930s, neither
goods nor money moved at all. With demand abroad at a
standstill and little capital available to stimulate local
economies, many nations of Latin America began to turn
inward and economic activity slowed to a crawl.
The state of Latin American society at the end of the 1930s
and into the 1940s was extraordinarily different from that
of the 1890s. Urbanization, immigration, social reforms,
and the imprint of charismatic leaders proposing radically
new political programs had combined to transform Latin
American capitals and major cities. Whereas the
countryside in most of the countries remained unchanged,
cities were fast approaching the cosmopolitan flavor of
their European counterparts. Demographic and economic
trends, along with Latin America’s assumption of a more
414central role in international trade, had profoundly affected
everyday life. Proscribed roles of gender, race, and class
were no longer immutable, just as geographic, national,
and ethnic barriers had expanded to bring a wider variety
of the new Americans onto the national stage.
Conclusion
The twentieth century was marked by the advent of
socialism, an ideology born in Europe but adapted to the
reality of poor societies in Asia, Latin America, and Africa
with varying degrees of success. Populism proved a more
compelling organizing principle in many countries, and the
attraction of powerful leaders – Perón, Vargas, Gaitán,
Haya de la Torre, and others – retooled the original
socialist campaign among the working class and traditional
leftist sectors. Many countries witnessed deep-seated
political and cultural changes during the first decades of
the twentieth century. Mass politics, modern cultural
expressions, and movements that demanded broader rights
for all members of society cropped up everywhere in Latin
America. In the case of Mexico, the demands exploded
onto the national scene, originating in the countryside and
enveloping the entire country. Finally, no account of the
twentieth century in Latin America can ignore the
profound importance of the rise to world dominance of the
United States, on the one hand, and the repeated outbreak
of multifaceted, anti-imperialist, nationalist, and socialist
struggles attempting to check US power and secure Latin
American self-determination, on the other. While apparent
as far back as 1923, with the articulation of the Monroe
Doctrine, and reinforced by the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary
– as well as frequent acts of “gunboat diplomacy” and
415other “Big Stick” interventions that marked the
implementation of those political doctrines – the full force
of US hegemony reached new heights during the second
half of the twentieth century, as a product of the Cold War
between the US and Soviet Union. The next chapter
explores the contours of that struggle.

Post-World War II Struggles for Sovereignty
The war that eventually engulfed much of the world from
1939 until 1945 did not produce the tremendous number of
casualties in Latin America as it did in Europe, Asia, and
Africa; however, it did not entirely pass the region by
either. Economically, Latin America benefited from the
worldwide demand for primary goods, especially copper,
oil, and agricultural commodities. A new feature of the
commodity chain from the producing side was the demand
for Mexican laborers to fill jobs in US agriculture left
vacant as men entered the army and women took positions
in basic industry. Politically, the conflict between right and
left playing out on a grand scale in other parts of the world
surfaced in far more muted contests between Latin
American fascist and communist movements.
World War II
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
the United States placed heavy pressure on Latin American
governments to cut off business and trade with the Axis
powers. Nevertheless, most attempted to remain neutral;
only Central American and Caribbean nations sided with
the Allies in 1941, although Mexico followed suit in 1942.
Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas, who had earlier flirted with
fascism, tried to retain his alliance with the US while also
maintaining cordial relations with Germany, which was
heavily invested in Brazilian industries. But in 1942 the
Nazis sunk a Brazilian ship, prompting Vargas to join the
417Allies. Colombia and Bolivia declared war on the Axis in
1943, but Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and
Ecuador waited another two years – when the war was
almost over – to follow suit. Argentina, with its
German-trained military, large German and Italian
populations, and substantial German investments, held out
as long as possible. It only entered on the side of the Allies
in March 1945, when the Axis defeat in Europe was a
certainty and the Japanese surrender less than five months
away (Map 10.1). At the same time, Argentina and Cuba,
along with the Dominican Republic (the peculiar
circumstances of which will be explained later in this
chapter), became a major refuge for Jews escaping
Nazi-held territories.

418Latin American countries’ lack of enthusiasm for the war
effort may reflect the fact that their economies neither
benefited, nor suffered terribly, during the war years. The
most pronounced impact was that wartime demand for
copper, tin, and oil bolstered the export economies of
Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Mexico, while demand for
sugar and tropical fruits was a boon to Central American
419and Caribbean nations. An important shift in commodity
exports took place, as the United States replaced Europe as
chief consumer. Consumption in Europe was stymied
during the war, and then drastically curtailed for decades
afterward. In addition to supplying North America’s
ravenous appetite for minerals, oil, resources, foodstuffs,
and manufactures, especially steel from Mexico and
Brazil, the war contributed to high levels of employment
and the expansion of basic industry in Latin America. In
Brazil, the change was dramatic since US investments
helped to build a national steel and chemical industry.
However, throughout the region disruptions in traditional
export markets and trade relations offset many of the gains
achieved in specific, war-related export commodities.
Mexico, more than any other Latin American nation,
supported the US effort by providing strategic resources
(copper, zinc, lead, mercury, graphite, and cadmium) and
instituting internal price controls to avoid profiteering.
Mexico’s national income almost tripled between 1940 and
1946, moving from 6.4 billion pesos in 1940 to 18.6 billion
in 1945. Per capita income also grew in the same period
(from 325 pesos to 838 pesos) although increases were not
evenly distributed. Without the ready supply of crucial raw
materials from Mexico and other parts of Latin America
US defense plants would have encountered great difficulty
making the rapid transition from peace to a wartime
production schedule.
Temporary Worker Program
The most controversial aspect of US–Mexico cooperation
was the Bracero Program. Taking its name from the
Spanish word for arm, brazo, the program began with an
420agreement in 1942 between Presidents Franklin Roosevelt
(1882–1945) and Manuel Ávila Camacho (1897–1955) to
recruit over 300,000 Mexicans as agricultural workers to
fill a US labor shortage caused by the combined impact of
military conscription and the massive influx of laborers
into more highly skilled, and remunerated, work in
armament factories. By the time the Bracero Program
ended in 1964, an estimated 4.6 million Mexicans had
participated. According to the terms, Mexican workers
received free transportation to and from the US to work in
jobs selected specifically not to displace US workers; they
were paid the minimum wage of $0.46 an hour, increased
to $0.57 an hour by the end of the war. Ideally, both US
and Mexican government inspectors monitored the work
camps to assure that laborers were being paid the
minimum wage, had good working conditions, and were
being provided with sanitary housing and other facilities.
During the war years American labor unions closely
monitored the situation to ensure that the braceros not
form a scab labor force, and that US employers would not
use them to depress the cost of labor. Employers held to
that part of the agreement during the war, but largely
abandoned it from 1950 until 1964. The program
functioned in over 25 states, including Minnesota and
Wisconsin, the Pacific Northwest, and throughout the
West, Southwest, and Southeast.
Growers in Texas did not originally ask for braceros,
mainly because the state had passed a number of highly
racist “Caucasian only” labor protections. When in 1944
Texan growers were desperate to fill vacancies in the
agricultural sector, the Mexican government refused to
send any, citing cases of Texas employers who refused to
421pay workers what they were owed, racial discrimination,
and lax enforcement of the agreed-upon protective
measures. Mexico did not relent until 1947, two years after
the end of World War II, when it finally allowed braceros
to work in Texas. Although the terms of the agreement
were not enforced everywhere, braceros were probably
better treated than Mexican agricultural workers at the
time. Given the deplorable conditions under which migrant
laborers live and work, then as now, the standard set for
the braceros’ working conditions may not have been too
high.
Recent scholarship indicates that whatever the intended
purpose of the Bracero Program when it was initiated, it
evolved into a means to provide cheap agricultural labor in
general, not simply to fill a wartime shortage. A study by
the Pew Hispanic Center demonstrates that more bracero
contracts were signed after the end of the war than during
it. The program ran from 1942 until 1964–19 years after
the end of World War II and almost a decade after the
Korean War (1950–3). The largest number of contracts
(450,000) was signed in 1956; that rate was maintained
until 1960. Thus several hundred thousand braceros
entered the US between 1942 and 1946 and then,
curiously, arrived in far greater numbers during the 1950s.
When, in 1954, the US entered a short, but severe,
post-war depression, organized labor called for an end to
the program on the basis that owners were using braceros
for jobs that could go to nativeborn US workers. Rather
than end the program, however, the government launched
“Operation Wetback” (its official name, adopted from the
derogatory reference to illegal immigrants who arrived in
the US after, presumably, swimming across the Rio
422Grande River). This military and paramilitary operation
conducted sweeps through urban neighborhoods where
many Mexicans lived and along the US-Mexico border.
Over a million workers and their families were deported,
many of whom had entered the US legally as braceros;
others had become US citizens.
When the economy picked up in the late 1950s,
agribusiness interests in California, the Southwest, and
Florida lobbied the US government to maintain, and even
extend, the Bracero Program; as a result over a million
laborers signed bracero contracts during the early 1960s.
The Pew Hispanic Center study tracks the correlation
between the decline in bracero contracts and the burst in
mechanization of US agriculture. By 1962, since machines
had replaced a large portion of agricultural work
previously done manually, growers required fewer
laborers, mainly for harvesting crops. For the braceros the
most brutal aspect of the plan occurred in the 1950s and
1960s when states, depending on the peculiarities of local
demand, began to ship the laborers back to Mexico – with
little to no warning, and no thanks at all.
This snapshot of the Bracero Program contains several
history lessons. First, most residents of the US are unaware
that without the work of Mexican migrants during World
War II and the Korean War, the US would not have been
able to produce enough food to meet demand on the home
front and for the military abroad. In fact, not until 2008
was it revealed that the Mexican government had taken a
part of the braceros’ wages and never paid it to the
workers themselves. One can assume that most of the
braceros were long dead by the time the Mexican
423government was forced to provide the compensation.
Second, US historians have been slow to recognize that the
Bracero Program was much more than a temporary,
stopgap measure to fill a wartime labor shortage. Instead, it
institutionalized through a bilateral agreement a practice in
which US business relied on cheap labor from Mexico to
depress prevailing wage levels, especially in agriculture, at
home. Finally, the main impact of the Bracero Program
was to lay the foundation for the exploitation of migrant
laborers from south of the border, on a seasonal and
as-needed basis, in agricultural fields bordering the
western, southwestern, and southeastern states. This
practice, which has only accelerated since the 1950s, has
served to provide the US consumer with the widest variety
of foods, at very low prices, of any major economy in the
world. Today, the pattern of reliance on low-cost,
transitory, and temporary labor established by the Bracero
Program has spread to virtually every form of manual
labor in the US, and as a “tradition” stands at the heart of
recent debates over the institutionalized “guestworker”
program designed to provide immigrants to fill low-wage
jobs.
Post-war Latin America
The most striking change in the post-war era was the
global shift in world domination and in the nature of
conflict between competing powers. By the 1950s
Europe’s authority in the Americas, as well as in Africa
and Asia, was a fraction of what it had been in 1900.
Except for a few colonial outposts held by Great Britain,
France, and Holland (including the Bahamas, Barbados,
Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua, Belize,
424Dominica, St. Kitts/Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and a
part of the Virgin Islands), Europe no longer exerted
significant influence in the hemisphere. The US had
become one of two “superpowers” and by the end of the
twentieth century, following the breakup of the Soviet
Union in 1991, had emerged as the most powerful military
and political force on the planet. With the exception of
Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, the United States
did not attempt to colonize the hemisphere, as had the
Europeans earlier; however, it did not hesitate to flex its
military might. The chumminess of the “Good Neighbor
Policy,” Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Latin American
foreign policy during the war years, gave way to an
aggressive stance more reminiscent of Teddy Roosevelt’s
“Big Stick” earlier in the century. When local workers
demanded higher wages and better working conditions
from US firms operating in a Latin country, for example,
or when governments moved to nationalize or tax
US-based corporations, Washington did not hesitate to step
in to overturn the offending government and replace it with
a more compliant regime.
By the mid-twentieth century many Latin Americans had
adopted new attitudes toward their own nations and
relations with the United States. A stronger nationalist
voice was being heard in many countries of the Americas,
from newly emergent groups interested in promoting
democratic traditions and national sovereignty. The
hypocrisy of fighting to end totalitarianism in Europe and
Asia while tolerating or even encouraging it at home was
not lost on a new generation of Latin Americans. As a
result of improved educational levels in the 1950s, the
citizenry was not as amenable to the kind of strict
425authoritarian rule that had existed earlier. Throughout
Latin America, increased industrialization, spurred by
wartime economies, accelerated demand for a more
educated workforce capable of handling everything from
technical and managerial tasks to operating more
sophisticated machinery. In the post-war decades the
number of students in universities grew at astonishing
rates. In Mexico the number ballooned from 76,000 in
1960 to 247,000 in 1970 and 1.3 million by 1987; in
Brazil, Latin America’s most populous nation, university
enrollment climbed from 95,000 in 1960 to 430,000 by
1970 and 1.8 million in 1980. Even in places where the
overall student population was small, increases were
remarkable. Peru’s student population grew fifteen-fold,
from 16,000 in 1950 to 246,000 in 1980; similarly, Chile’s
went from 9,000 in 1950 to 120,000 at the beginning of the
1970s.
In a phenomenon that occurred throughout the world, as
well as in Latin America, members of the rising middle
class, and their newly educated male and female children,
were no longer content to languish under the control of a
distant elite. Large numbers of women had entered higher
education for the first time, and began to make modest
inroads into the professions and other employment outside
the home. Universityeducated youths, many the first in
their family to complete high school, much less college,
expected to join a workforce where education opened
doors to better jobs and professions, and to a role in
determining the governance and direction of the societies
in which they lived. University faculties and
administrations also grew, giving rise to a large,
426progressively minded, and usually left-leaning voice
within an organized institutional setting.
In addition, new institutions of higher learning reached
locales where youths previously had little access to the
world of ideas and technology, or means to obtain a better
future than that of their parents. The most elite national
universities were located in capital cities, but
well-qualified young women and men in more isolated
provinces also began to attend universities in the late
1960s. The impact on the nature of the ideological
discourse throughout Latin America was nothing short of
earth shattering. Privileged oligarchies, military
dictatorships, and the landed elite did not fit well with a
new generation’s conception of a society devoted to the
furtherance of a shared public sphere – including libraries,
parks, schools, and recreational facilities, as well as
publicly owned infrastructure and a government
bureaucracy – that existed to serve everyone, rather than
only a select few. Finally, a larger mass of educated people
translated into a larger proportion of society concerned
with inequality, since Latin America’s intellectuals had
historically been preoccupied with issues of social justice.
Referring to Latin America in the 1950s, Jean Franco
explains why: “Marxism attracted the intelligentsia
because it offered a rational explanation of inequality and
the goal of liberation from imperialism, both formal and
informal.”1 Moreover, injustice was everywhere. If the
middle class had grown, prosperity had barely touched the
poorest segment of most countries, leaving both the rural
and urban poor eking out a subsistence living or crowded
into burgeoning makeshift settlements on the outskirts of
the cities (Figures 10.1 and 10.2).

Military vs. Civilian Rule
Increased educational levels, along with a greater
awareness of the struggle for democracy and against
colonialism enveloping many parts of the world –
especially Africa – placed many young, informed Latin
Americans on a collision course with their own
governments. For the United States, however, the
watchword of the post-war era vis-à-vis relations with
Latin America, and the rest of the world, was stability:
meaning a stable environment for multinational
investment. With the passage of the Military Defense
Assistance Act in 1951, the exact nature of what the US
government envisioned as the best means of ensuring
stability became clear. Initially the Act provided for $38.5
million to the militaries of individual Latin American
nations so that they could build up “country missions” for
428their own internal security. Since no Latin American
countries were at war with each other, and since funding
every country’s military establishment would seem a poor
way of preventing conflict among and between them, the
purpose was clearly something else. The US wanted Latin
American militaries to police their respective civilian
populations to ensure domestic stability. In the years since,
a much broader and more comprehensive Military
Assistance Act has provided billions of dollars for
hardware and training to individual militaries in the
hemisphere. Needless to say, the US seldom invaded or
strong-armed its way into a Latin America country, nor
showered its largess on a country’s military, without the
express approval – or even invitation – from the military,
urban and agricultural elites, and politicians. When under
pressure local oligarchies were inclined to run to the
American embassy and demand US military protection
from uprisings by their own citizenry.

mainly recent migrants from the countryside and
neighboring countries offer little in the way of schools,
parks, and access to public transportation. Residents in this
Buenos Aires community have established their own
schools, soup kitchens, and cooperative gardens, but
children still have little open space to play. (Nancy

429Additionally, in 1946 the US inaugurated a key institution
for the formal training of Latin American military officers:
the School of the Americas (SOA), dubbed “the School of
Assassins” by Newsweek magazine. In 2001 it was
renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security
Cooperation (WHISC). Originally located in the Panama
Canal Zone, and moved in 1984 to Fort Benning, Georgia,
the SOA has graduated some of the most famous dictators
in Latin American history, including General Augusto
Pinochet who led the 1973 overthrow of Chile’s elected
president, Salvador Allende (1908–73); Manuel Noriega
(b. 1935), a close associate of the US until his friendship
proved to be no longer expedient and he was deposed by
the very government that had him, literally, on the payroll;
as well as the leaders of notorious death squads, such as El
Salvador’s Roberto D’Aubisson (1944–92). The particular
role of these and other military leaders will be explained
430later in this and subsequent chapters. A key purpose of the
SOA was to create military officers loyal to the US, and to
rule out attempts by errant, often junior, military officers
who militantly disagreed with the existing government and
sought to install more representative leadership, as
happened during the 1922 Brazilian tenentes revolt,
Augusto Sandino’s guerrilla war against the US occupation
of Nicaragua in the 1930s, and a 1944 junior officer revolt
in Guatemala. The founding of the SOA in 1946 was
consistent with a US Cold War policy that favored the
installation of military governments as a way of
maintaining order. From Washington’s point of view, the
policy was enormously successful. By 1954, pro-US
military dictatorships were in power in 13 of 20 Latin
American nations.
The Absolute Dictator: Rafael Trujillo
Quite possibly the best example of the absolute dictator,
whose loyalty to the United States bordered on the
fanatical, was Rafael Trujillo Molina (1891–1961) who
ruled the Dominican Republic personally, or through his
surrogates, from 1930 until his assassination in 1961. A
product of the US military occupation of the island from
1916 to 1924, Trujillo at age 18 joined the National Guard,
a local Dominican military force formed during the US
Marine occupation army to maintain order.
President Woodrow Wilson had dispatched a Marine force
to the Dominican Republic after the 1911 assassination of
Ramón Cáceres, a reform politician who had attempted to
modernize and reform Dominican society during his time
in office (1906–11). Disliked by the local landowning elite
431and distrusted by US sugar interests, which owned the
majority of mills on the island, Cáceres had little
opportunity to enact change, and the fighting that broke
out after his death dismantled what had been put in place.
During the Marine occupation, US companies and soldiers
made a number of improvements, including building a
system of roads and telegraph lines, improving sanitation
and educational facilities, and eradicating disease. When
they departed the Marines left behind a military force
trained to protect US interests, with a designated
commander. Over the next six years the National Guard
became the Dominican National Police and finally the
National Armed Forces. Trujillo moved in step with each
new military permutation; in 1928 he became leader of the
Armed Forces, and then self-appointed president of the
country in 1930 (see Box 10.1).
The extent of Trujillo’s control was legendary. For
example, he had the hotel rooms and press offices of
international correspondents bugged and employed spies to
move among workplaces, government offices, and even on
the street to report back any conversations that were
anything less than supportive of the regime. During
Trujillo’s administration there were many improvements to
infrastructure, including roads, communication and
transportation networks, and a fair amount of construction
– but all the work was done either by the president’s own
companies or others from which he extracted robust bribes.
The improvements, many of which earned him a genuine
core of supporters among ordinary Dominicans, were not
only personally lucrative but also facilitated oversight of
the population. Speed bumps were interspersed along
roads to slow down traffic at the hundreds of check points;
432police and personal servants traveled along the streets to
make sure that every house had a picture of the leader on
display, lit up and visible from the street. The roads and
telegraph lines were also crucial for moving people
around. To guarantee an adequate workforce for his many
sugar estates and other enterprises, busloads of people and
materials were moved in and required to stay until Trujillo
allowed them to leave. The rest of the time peasants were
tied to the land, requiring a government permit to move
from one place to another.
Box 10.1
Eduardo Galeano wrote a partially tongue-in-cheek
summary of the tentacles of Trujillo’s reach, which
would be humorous if it were not true:
1936 Trujillo City
Trujillo, tireless bane of reds and heretics, was, like
Anastasio Somoza, born of a U.S. military
occupation. His natural modesty does not prevent
him from allowing his name to appear on
automobile license plates and his likeness on all
postage stamps, nor does he oppose the conferring
of the rank of colonel on his three-year-old son
Ramfis, as an act of simple justice. His sense of
responsibility obliges him to appoint personally all
ministers, porters, bishops, and beauty queens. To
stimulate the spirit of enterprise, Trujillo grants the
433salt, tobacco, oil, cement, flour, and match
monopolies to Trujillo. In defense of public health,
Trujillo closes down businesses that do not sell
meat from the Trujillo slaughterhouses or milk
from his dairy farms; and for the sake of public
security he makes obligatory the purchase of
insurance policies sold by Trujillo. Firmly grasping
the helm of progress, Trujillo releases the Trujillo
enterprises from taxes, while providing his estates
with irrigation and roads and his factories with
customers. By order of the Trujillo shoe
manufacturer, anyone caught barefoot on the
streets of town or city goes to jail.
The all-powerful has a voice like a whistle, with
which there is no discussion. At supper, he clinks
glasses with a governor or deputy who will be off
to the cemetery after coffee. When a piece of land
interests him, he doesn’t buy it; he occupies it.
When a woman appeals to him, he doesn’t seduce
her; he points at her.
Quoted in Galeano, Century of the Wind, v. 3, pp.
105–6.
This description captures the essence of Trujillo’s
rule, and refers to actual events. For example,
Galeano’s reference to a beauty queen refers to
Trujillo’s 18-year-old daughter, Angelita, whom he
434had crowned Queen Angelita Trujillo in December
1955 at an extravagant event (the National Fair of
Peace and Brotherhood of the Free World), to
which Trujillo invited the world’s dignitaries. The
Fair cost $50 million (in a country where annual
per capita income was $240), and although
attendance was mandatory for select Dominicans,
almost no foreign dignitary attended.
A fitness fanatic and very careful dresser, Trujillo refused
to allow anyone to walk barefoot in the capital; shoe stalls
were in place on all roads leading into the city so that the
poor who had no shoes could rent them when attendance in
the capital was required. Smoking in public and
automobiles was not allowed, and even on the hottest days
men were required to wear jackets and ties in the capital.
Not only were there no permits to carry guns, but also it
was illegal to walk with a coat over one’s arm or wear
khaki trousers and shirts of the same color since Trujillo
had determined that it was easier to hide a weapon while in
such attire. Costly permits were required to hold any
festivals or parties, except for gatherings with the
immediate family.
After Pearl Harbor the Dominican Republic immediately
declared war on the Axis powers, while steadily exporting
sugar, cocoa, and coffee at good prices to supply the war
effort. Like the Nicaraguan dictator Somoza, whose
trajectory and methods were closely parallel, Trujillo could
be relied on to back the US in whatever international
435dispute arose. A notable departure from US policy was the
Dominican Republic’s acceptance in 1939 of Spanish
Republicans forced into exile after the Spanish Civil War
and triumph of the fascist government headed by General
Francisco Franco. In addition, the Dominican Republic
welcomed Jews escaping the Nazi takeover of Europe. On
the surface it seems peculiar that Trujillo, who openly
admired fascist ideology, was willing to admit its victims,
even those, such as the Republicans, with leftist
sympathies. In both cases it was apparently the whiteness
of the refugees that mattered more to Trujillo a man who
obsessively declared his Spanish heritage and deleted his
grandmother’s Haitian nationality from every official
record – than their ideology. One of the earliest examples
of Trujillo’s whitening campaign occurred in October 1937
when he ordered the killing of 25,000 Haitians in the
border area between the two countries. In a little over a
day Dominican soldiers hacked to death thousands of
black Haitian men, women, and children migrant laborers
who had crossed the border to work on Dominican sugar
plantations. After a mild protest from Washington and
demands for reparations from Haiti, the Dominican
Republic paid $522,000, or $29 for every officially
recognized death.
In 1956 Trujillo’s agents apprehended a Dominican exile.
Jésus de Galindez, a Columbia University professor and
outspoken critic of the regime, off the street near his New
York apartment. Galindez was smuggled onto an airplane,
returned to the Dominican Republic, tortured and killed.
The Galindez matter was an embarrassment for the Dwight
Eisenhower administration when it was revealed that the
plane was piloted by US citizen Gerald Murphy whose
436relationship with the FBI has always cast a shadow on the
extent to which the US government was complicit in
Galindez’ murder. Two other incidents pushed things over
the edge. In June 1959, six months after the triumphant
Cuban Revolution, a group of Dominican exiles, with the
support of Fidel Castro (b. 1926) and Rómulo Betancourt
(1908–81), the reformist president of Venezuela, landed on
Dominican shores with the intention of overthrowing
Trujillo. Instead, the conspirators and their Dominican
allies were arrested, jailed, and/or executed. Furious with
Betancourt, Trujillo ordered Dominican agents to place a
bomb in the Venezuelan president’s car in Caracas, which
exploded, injuring Betancourt. In response to Venezuela’s
outcry, the OAS (Organization of American States)
expelled the Dominican Republic. Another case concerned
the apprehension and murder of three sisters who were
members of the prominent Mirabal family, and whose
father was an outspoken critic of Trujillo. The women, all
young mothers and critics of the regime, were killed when
their car was forced off the road on the way back from
visiting their husbands, who were in jail for plotting to
overthrow the dictator. Julia Alvarez (b. 1950), one of the
Dominican Republic’s most prominent authors, chronicled
the story in her book In the Time of the Butterflies, later
made into a movie starring Salma Hayek.
Trujillo’s downfall
By 1960 Washington had decided that Trujillo’s unfailing
loyalty was not enough to excuse his embarrassingly
lawless behavior, and took steps to rein him in by levying
a special excise tax on Dominican sugar entering the US.
To retaliate, Trujillo brazenly dispatched agents to Eastern
437Europe, presumably with the intent of investigating a new
market for sugar, but more likely as an affront to the US.
In response the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sent
arms to opposition groups in the Dominican Republic and,
either directly or indirectly, had Trujillo killed in his car on
May 30, 1961. Although the CIA did not at the time admit
assassinating such a longtime ally and loyal supporter, the
release of classified documents have since confirmed the
intelligence agency’s responsibility.
In the years since Trujillo’s downfall, the Dominican
Republic has gone through a number of presidents, but no
single administration has been able to resolve the profound
economic disparities that plague the island. The poorest
half of the population receives less than one-fifth of the
gross national product, while the richest 10 percent enjoys
nearly 40 percent of national income; nearly 20 percent of
the population is perpetually unemployed, and over
one-quarter live below the poverty line. Statistics on
literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy for men and
women are some of the most unfavorable in the
hemisphere. Large numbers of Dominicans have migrated
to the United States, where they have turned
neighborhoods such as Washington Heights in upper
Manhattan and Jamaica Plain in Boston into Dominican
enclaves. Entire communities on the island live on
remittances sent back by relatives in the US, a very few of
whom are high-paid baseball players and fashion designers
such as Sammy Sosa and Oscar de la Renta. However,
overwhelmingly they are minimum-wage-earning workers
in service sector and manufacturing jobs, or owners of
small businesses, especially bodegas (grocery stores).
438Americas in Transition: Guatemala and Bolivia
In the years before and immediately following World War
II, the US tolerated authoritarian regimes in Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Cuba and other countries, as long as those
governments maintained a stable environment for
investment and trade and supported the US in international
policy forums. Nonetheless, many nations attempted to
install democratic governments and to transform unequal
conditions into ones of relative social and economic
equality. Two examples of such attempts were in
Guatemala and Bolivia, both of which were successful for
a while, but ultimately were derailed by a combination of
powerful interests from abroad operating in alliance with
domestic conservative sectors intent on preserving the
traditional distribution of wealth and power.
Guatemala
From the time of independence in the mid-nineteenth
century until the 1940s, Guatemala was under the rule of
military leaders who served the interests of a small group
of landed elite and the export market to which they
supplied cotton, coffee, bananas, and other fruit. In the
post-World War II era, Guatemala received ample foreign
investment to support the growth of foreign-owned and
-operated manufacturing, including food processing,
pharmaceuticals, and some basic industry. The country’s
long history of ignoring the needs of its impoverished
citizens – above all the indigenous QuicheMaya population
– began to change in 1944 when a group of junior military
officers, intent on bringing about greater social equality,
overthrew the ruling clique and set the stage for elections.
439This “October Revolution,” as it was called, brought to
power a former teacher and moderate reformer, Juan José
Arévalo (1904–90). Although originally installed in office
by force, Arévalo was subsequently elected to the
presidency, from which he presided over the writing of a
new constitution that shared many similarities with the
Mexican Constitution of 1917. During his five-year term
Arévalo initiated a process of constitutional rule by law,
outlined a series of economic and social improvements
(though most did not get beyond the planning stage),
survived 22 attempted military revolts against his
government, and managed to oversee the orderly election
of his successor, Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán (1913–71).
Arbenz, a junior officer who had participated in the 1944
October Revolution before transitioning to civilian life,
became in 1950 the first president in Guatemala’s history
to enter office through the electoral arena.
Despite the election, democratic institutions were
exceedingly weak, and power remained concentrated in an
elite minority. In addition to a small number of latifundia
in the hands of single families or family-based
corporations, much of the land in Guatemala was held by
the United Fruit Company (UFCO), whose role in the 1928
Colombian “banana massacre” was discussed in Chapter 8.
The company not only owned land; it also controlled
freight and shipping rates, owned and operated the
telegraph service, and maintained a vast network of
company housing for the seasonally employed workforce
overseen by a cadre of imported supervisors and estate
managers, many from Alabama. Operating under the Jim
Crow laws of the US South, United Fruit had imposed on
Guatemala, Colombia, and other places a set of policies
440taken straight from the segregationist handbook, including
one that required “all persons of color to give the right of
way to whites and remove their hats while talking to
them.”
Like his predecessor, Arbenz found that he had little
latitude to bring about change; however, he embarked on a
policy to add economic reforms to the moderate political
reforms his predecessor initiated. His plan called for
strengthening the Guatemalan private sector by facilitating
the growth of nationally owned firms; increasing control
over domestic resources and exploiting natural resources,
especially oil; and encouraging public works projects
contracted to private firms to boost employment. He
required foreign firms to pay taxes (including income
taxes) and to abstain from intervening in domestic affairs.
By far the most daring innovation was an agrarian reform
law passed in June 1952. The law called for the
expropriation of uncultivated plots from large plantations,
to be paid for in 25-year government bonds, at a three
percent interest rate, based on the land’s reported
valuation in May 1952.
The agrarian reform, modeled on the US Homestead Act
of 1862, proposed to distribute 1.5 million acres of
uncultivated, expropriated land to 100,000 families –
including 1,700 acres belonging to Arbenz and his
Salvadoran wife, María Cristina Vilanova. Not
surprisingly, this plan met with opposition from the
traditional oligarchy and from the UFCO, which owned an
estimated 85 percent of Guatemala’s land. In addition, the
giant company had consistently undervalued its holdings
for tax purposes. Therefore, when the Guatemalan
441government offered to pay at the tax-assessed value of
$627,572, UFCO protested, arguing that the land was
actually worth over $15 million. Essentially, after having
cheated the Guatemalan government for years, United
Fruit argued that it was actually owed more than $15
million for assets it had never reported.
Immediately United Fruit raised the alarm among its US
stockholders and many sympathizers in the US and
Guatemala. The company had many friends in high places,
including President Eisenhower’s Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles (1888–1959), and his younger brother, CIA
Director Allen Dulles (1893–1969), both of whom had
been partners in a New York law firm whose foremost
client was the United Fruit Company. Stephen Kinzer and
Stephen Schlesinger’s comprehensive account, Bitter
Fruit: The Untold Story of the CIA Coup in Guatemala,
dissects the overlapping web of players connecting the US
State Department, the CIA, United Fruit Company, and
members of the Guatemalan military who engineered the
overthrow of Arbenz. Key operatives, such as E. Howard
Hunt, J. C. King, and David Sánchez Morales, played a
role in the Guatemalan coup and from there went on to
notoriety as CIA operatives and dirty tricksters in the
failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the 1972
Watergate break-in of the Democratic Party headquarters
in Washington, DC. Despite its role in opposing Arbenz
and agrarian reform, there is considerable dispute over
how actively United Fruit was involved in engineering the
coup. With Washington in the throes of Joseph
McCarthy’s anti-communist witch hunt, and the CIA eager
to flex its muscles on a new “regime change” after a
successful intervention in Iran in 1953 to overthrow
442Mohammad Mossadegh (whose politics were considered
too independent for the US), neither the mainstream media
nor Congress required much convincing.
In spite of efforts from members of Arbenz’s
administration to compromise with their US critics, and
even the reluctance of some top members of Guatemala’s
own military to support the coup, the CIA succeeded in
forcing President Arbenz to resign in June 1954. After
some squabbling among Guatemalan strongmen, General
Castillo Armas (1914–57) assumed leadership of the
military government that essentially handed rule back to
the oligarchy, foreign multinationals, and, until it was
indicted on antitrust charges, the United Fruit Company.
The US-backed coup received little support from Latin
American governments, with the exception of its two
staunchest allies, Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo and
Anastasio Somoza García of Nicaragua.
Guatemala after the coup
In the decades following the downfall of Arbenz, dreams
of building a democratic society disappeared. The largest
and most populous country of Central America entered one
of its darkest phases, characterized by brutal repression of
the majority Indian population at the hands of the military,
widespread civil and human rights violations, a free hand
to corrupt military and civilian police forces, and
ultimately a 36-year-long civil war in the 1970s and 1980s
that resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and
displacement of more than a million. Mountainsides were
wiped clean of villages, as military and civilian death
squads ravaged entire communities, leaving behind
443horrible evidence of torture, death, and destruction.
Decades after the 1954 military coup that unseated
President Arbenz, Guatemala’s 15 million people have a
literacy rate of under 70 percent, life expectancy of less
than 69 years, and one of the highest infant mortality rates
in the hemisphere. The lack of social progress is presided
over by a political apparatus that, despite the 1996 peace
accords and return to civilian rule, has never been able to
establish a fully functioning civil society. According to the
annual review posted on the Human Rights Watch website,
even under civilian rule Guatemala has made little
progress toward functioning under the rule of law.
“Guatemala’s weak and corrupt law enforcement
institutions have proven incapable of containing the
powerful organized crime groups that, among other things,
are believed responsible for continuing attacks on human
rights defenders.”2
Revolution in Bolivia
Like Guatemala, Bolivia underwent a period of profound
hope for social change in the early 1950s, only to flounder,
leaving the nation in a state of unrelenting poverty. The
modern state of Bolivia was carved from the colonial
province of Upper Peru, a mountainous Andean region that
was overshadowed in the colonial era by the viceroyalty in
Lima. During the wars for independence Bolívar hoped to
unite the two territories into a larger, more effective and
viable nation, but local loyalties and a weak, fragmented
leadership dashed those aspirations. In 1825 Spanish
Royalist troops scattered or defected and General Sucre’s
rebel army liberated the area and established, separate
from Peru, a new nation named “Bolivia,” after Latin
444America’s most famous liberator. In the wake of
independence Bolivia was briefly the focus of contention
among the longerstanding and more powerful emerging
states of Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Landlocked since
losing its access to the sea to Chile in the late nineteenth
century War of the Pacific – illustrating Bolivia’s
difficulty in fending off the incursions of its more powerful
neighbors – it has lacked a sea port for the shipment
abroad of its valuable resources: silver, tin, natural gas,
textiles, and foodstuffs, as well as coca. Its fragmented
political structure is best illustrated by the fact that since
the nineteenth century Bolivia has had two capitals: La Paz
as the seat of government, Sucre as the historical capital
and home of the judiciary. The city of Santa Cruz is the
industrial and commercial center.
The history of Bolivian mining, encompassing gold and
silver in the colonial period (the latter from the famed
“mountain of silver” at Potosí), as well as tin, zinc, and
iron ore in the twentieth century, has been one in which the
indigenous people who comprise roughly 70 percent of the
population have toiled for very little reward, instead
benefiting distant colonial or imperial powers at the other
end of the commodity chain. Bolivia’s current population
of just 9 million people, sparsely distributed over a
formidably arid, mountainous, and mineral-rich terrain, is
comprised of the descendants of ancient Aymara, Guaraní,
and Quechua people, most of whom speak an indigenous
language primarily, and Spanish secondarily, if at all.
Bolivia today is one of the main repositories of natural gas
in the Americas, and even the world. Current president
Juan Evo Morales Ayma (b. 1959) was elected in 2005 on
445a socialist platform, promising to retain the greatest share
of profit from the sale of goods and resources, especially
natural gas, for the benefit of Bolivians. But the current
government is not the first to seek to use Bolivia’s
considerable export revenues for the benefit of the nation.
In 1952 a coalition comprising urban professionals
(especially teachers and academics), commercial and
government workers, and some entrepreneurs, along with
miners and rural peasants, succeeded in overthrowing the
government of the latifundistas and mine owners.
Although Bolivian workers, especially miners, had worked
under near slave-labor conditions for centuries (formal
servitude only ended in some areas in 1945), their
grievances fell on deaf ears until the late 1940s and early
1950s.
Under the leadership of Víctor Paz Estenssoro
(1907–2001) and his Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario
(MNR, National Revolutionary Movement), Indian miners
and peasants took up arms in 1952 and for the first time in
Bolivia’s history enacted a radical reform agenda. The
MNR’s success came about as a result of several factors,
primarily a vacuum in military leadership that coincided
with the emergence of a viable and activist civilian base.
Not only was the political and economic influence of
urban-based mestizos increasing in the 1950s, but for a
variety of reasons they were willing to align with the
largely indigenous working class, a group they had
previously shunned. The MNR and Paz Estenssoro
managed to pull together an alliance that had proven
elusive in the past. Although Paz Estenssoro’s reform
objectives closely resembled the measures that Arévalo
and Arbenz were embarking upon at roughly the same time
446in Guatemala, Bolivia’s revolution fell short more as the
result of internal factors than external pressure. The MNR
government embarked on an agrarian reform that broke up
large estates, creating minifundio parcels that could be
worked by individual peasant families or small clan and
village groups. In addition, the reform intended to deliver
credit for the purchase of tools, seed, and other materials,
as well as to provide technical assistance to teach farmers
how to increase productivity. The latter part of the plan
was never delivered and, as a result, over a period of years
the newly allotted minifundio gradually fell back into the
hands of powerful landowners with access to credit,
technical assistance, water for irrigation, and markets for
their goods.
In addition, the MNR sought to unify the country by
breaking down the barriers that separated the majority
indigenous population from Spanish-speaking Creoles,
first by dropping the literacy requirement for voting – and
thereby instantly incorporating the Indian masses into their
base of support – and second by fostering the creation of
sindicatos (unions) of peasants. Since the peasantry had
been occupying the large estates in the wake of the
landowners’ flight from the land during the first days of
the Revolution, the government’s move to grant them the
right to organize actually sanctioned a fait accompli.
In the end, it appears that Paz Estenssoro’s revolutionary
council authorized sindicatos for the peasantry not so
much as a means to support their struggle for better wages
and working conditions, but instead as a strategy to keep
the minifundistas from developing close ties with the
powerful and militant mine workers. In later years, when
447the government failed to grant the demands of the peasants
for credit and other resources, the rural workers found
themselves isolated from the miners. Many peasants,
feeling they had a stake in the status quo and fearful of
losing rights to their land, even lined up with subsequent
conservative governments against their previous allies in
the working class, especially the miners. The loyalty
toward the government that the land reform had
engendered in a significant fraction of the peasantry was
apparent in 1966-7 when Ernesto “Che” Guevara
(1928–67), the Argentine-born hero of the Cuban
Revolution, attempted to spark an uprising of the peasantry
in the southeastern Andean foothills, only to meet with
little local cooperation and even betrayal. The few
Bolivians who joined Che’s abortive cause came from
urban areas, while the peasantry steered clear of the
outsiders who neither spoke the local language, nor
understood the land tenure arrangements that had been
negotiated between the government and the peasantry.
Mining and the Voice of Bolivian Activism
The most important change wrought by the 1952
revolution was the nationalization of the principal tin
mines, most of which had been in the hands of three
companies: Hochschild, Patiño, and Aramayo. According
to one contemporary observer, the sale of the companies
did not accrue significant benefit to the Bolivian people.
The owners only sold off the mines after the tin was
depleted; new mine owners eventually took over the mines
and other resources, and “as bad luck would have it, new
rich people have been created and the [common] people
haven’t enjoyed any benefits from the nationalization.”
448After 1952 the mines were operated under Comibol, a
state-run management/ labor board, which was designed to
distribute a fair share of benefits to miners. However, by
1963 the management board was squarely in the hands of
the owners, who, a bit too conveniently, claimed to have
no more money to share with the workers. Tin prices, like
those of copper in Chile, often fluctuated on world
markets, rising and falling in sync with large-scale wars
and manufacturing booms and busts. After World War II a
decline in both tin and copper prices swept across the
globe, throwing Bolivia and Chile into a depression as
their main source of export revenues shrank in value. By
the mid-1950s, as the price of tin on the international
market plummeted, the MNR cut back on the share of
export earnings earmarked for maintaining its reform
agenda. Wages for miners declined, prices rose as Bolivia
struggled to meet international payments on loans, and
planned social services were all but eliminated. Paz
Estenssoro and the MNR moved to the right, bit by bit
abandoning the socialist program on which they had come
into office.
In the impoverished Bolivian highlands of the
mid-twentieth century, Domitila Barrios de Chúngara (b.
1937) became one of the most outstanding champions of
the Latin American working class, overcoming barriers of
gender and socioeconomic status. From her humble roots
and difficult childhood, Domitila grew into an independent
and strong-willed woman who went to incredible lengths
to fight the injustices suffered by tin miners, their wives,
peasants, and all Bolivians she saw as oppressed by the
mine owners and authoritarian governments. Although she
had only a sixth-grade education, her observations and
449understanding of the complexities of economics, law, and
labor issues far surpassed those of others with more
privileged upbringings. She drew the attention of both
international and domestic organizations to the plight of
poor Bolivians, at one point tersely dismissing the efforts
of a government official to intimidate the workers with
columns of facts and figures on a blackboard with the
remark: “Well, we don’t live off of numbers. We live from
reality.”3
The reality was grim. Workers in the tin mines of the
Bolivian highlands labored under exploitative and unsafe
conditions, and were forced to live in company-owned
housing that could be taken away with no notice. The
average life expectancy of a tin miner in the mid-1960s
was 35 years. Women married to miners had few rights
when widowed, abandoned, or charged with the care of
children and husbands incapacitated from disease and
accidents. Frustrated by this situation, Domitila became the
leader of the Housewives’ Committee of Siglo XX, formed
in 1961 with the aim of joining efforts of men and women
in the community to organize against the horrific abuses
and poverty suffered by workers and their families. Her
involvement in labor movements and a large number of
strikes and demonstrations to create jobs for women,
improve the conditions of miners, and fight repression
brought her into conflict with those in power. Her activism
resulted in multiple arrests, during which she suffered
greatly for her cause, leading hunger strikes, falling victim
to brutality and torture, and even losing an unborn child.
Despite setbacks, danger to herself and her family, and
constant discouragement, she was able to win modest
450improvements in the lives of miners and peasants (see Box
10.2).
Box 10.2 Let Me Speak! The voice of a Bolivian
activist
Domitila’s story is chronicled in a testimony
compiled with Moema Viezzer, following her
involvement in the International Women’s Year
Tribunal in Mexico, organized by the United
Nations in 1975. Her remarks demonstrate her
determination and loyalty to the cause of ending
oppression of the working class and her decision to
put herself and her family second to the struggle to
overcome the misery of others. One particularly
striking example of her courage comes from a
confrontation she and other labor organizers had
with representatives of the repressive General
Hugo Banzer (dictator 1971–8, later elected
President 1997-2001), after their destruction of
Siglo XX’s radio transmitters in response to a
strike. Domitila bravely stood up to those in power,
and eloquently expressed her opinions on the
repressive regime:
We women, like the workers, repudiate this attempt
against our culture and our people... We won’t
stand for this treatment. And we demand you
immediately return our property, which has cost us
so much to get... General Banzer has taken office
451in a country where no one elected him. He came in
through the force of arms, he killed a whole lot of
people and among them our children and our
compañeros. He machine-gunned the university; he
repressed and goes on repressing a lot of people.
Our resources are being turned over to foreigners,
especially to Brazil.
Now I ask you, which measure has been in favor of
the working class?

Speak! (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978),

The Revolution in Decline
Throughout the late 1950s, the Bolivian people witnessed
systematic erosion in the revolutionary goals that had
mobilized the masses earlier in the decade. The Bolivian
government moved to restore the mines to their previous
owners, even offering to pay them concessions. It invited
in new foreign investors, ended labor’s participation in
Comibol, reduced welfare benefits to disabled and
out-of-work miners, and refused to offer miners protection
when they went out on strike. Instead, Paz Estenssoro
ordered the army to break up strikes, and even to gun
down workers on the picket line. By the early 1960s, the
military, mine owners, and landed oligarchy had gained in
strength, and in May 1964 the military formally returned to
power under General René Barrientos (1919–69). While
452the US denied any direct involvement in the Barrientos
coup and subsequent repression, the soldiers and police
who restored the oligarchy to power were enthusiastic
followers of the US, had been trained on US bases in
Central America and the United States (including the
School of the Americas), and fought with planes, tanks,
and machine guns manufactured in and provided by the
United States. Despite periodic and widespread opposition
from students, miners, peasants, and even some reformist
nationalists among the armed forces and domestic
bourgeoisie, various authoritarian civilian and military
governments remained in power from 1964 until the end of
the century. In 1980 Colonel García Meza (b. 1932), a
dictator known not only for his repressive rule but for
bringing Bolivia into international drug-dealing circles,
came to power in the aptly named “Cocaine Coup.” During
García Meza’s first year in office, the price of coca leaves
jumped from $50 to $15,000 a ton and, coincidentally or
not, Bolivia’s economy (like others in Latin America) fell
into a depression, creating just the desperate economic
climate needed to convince many small farmers to turn to
coca production. Only somewhat later, however, did the
highly lucrative illicit drug trade achieve a firm foothold in
Bolivia’s economy.
Similarities between Guatemala and Bolivia are
instructive. They are both lands with majority, or near
majority, indigenous populations, mountainous terrain,
poor and isolated Indian communities, reliance on outside
investors and markets for trade of a limited number of
goods, a long history of exploitation at the hands of local
and national caudillos, and power structures controlled by
white or mestizo elites. Nonetheless, both nations
453experienced genuine, widespread social movements in the
1950s that attempted to put in place a more equitable
social and political order. Both saw dreams of democracy,
stability, and prosperity dashed by the combined forces of
an entrenched elite and military, backed by the US
government and transnational corporations. In both cases
the decades from the 1950s onward have witnessed
disastrous rates of infant mortality, poverty, illiteracy,
death rates far above those of other nations in the region,
and widespread discontent. Guatemalans suffered
enormous consequences stemming from the unwillingness
of the ruling elite to share even a portion of the wealth
with the impoverished majority. Their position was
secured with assistance from the CIA and US government
in the 1950s. Similarly, Bolivia has suffered years of
stagnation, but at this writing, the current President
Morales’ ability to win over the entrenched oligarchy and
sectors of the country that control water and natural gas
resources to a program that would distribute wealth more
equally remains in question.
Conclusion
The outcome of World War II was pivotal to the
realignment of power in the second half of the twentieth
century. Latin America had played only a marginal role in
the war, but it had benefited from selling raw materials and
thus emerged with the potential to experience more
long-term economic prosperity. By contrast, the
introduction of cheap labor from Mexico in the Bracero
Program showed US industries the potential for enormous
profits by exploiting cheap labor. The temporary worker
program ended in 1964, though since that time large
454numbers of laborers from Latin America have crossed the
border illegally to work at below minimum wage levels in
agriculture and many other areas of employment. In the
1960s, simultaneous with the end of the Bracero Program,
US companies stepped up investments in Latin America,
transplanting operations from high-wage Ohio, Michigan,
Pennsylvania, and other communities to low-wage
Guatemala, Brazil, Chile, and Peru and more.
In the post-war era the protection of US “interests” became
increasingly tied to a policy of protecting US corporations
against any demands for better wages and working
conditions from domestic workers in Latin America.
Companies such as United Fruit called on the US
government to come to their aid when they found their
profits threatened by political and economic reformists in
Latin America. The case of Guatemala began to repeat
throughout the hemisphere. Simultaneously, the politics of
the Cold War left no place for neutrality, and allowed the
traditional Latin American elite to dismiss indigenous calls
for reform, for labor rights, for better wages and living
conditions as “Soviet interference.” The polarized political
situation provided entrenched elites in many countries with
an excuse for their failure to provide for the public good.
Liberal reformists, such as Arbenz and Paz Estenssoro,
were few, but even their meager attempts to hold
multinational corporations accountable met with stiff
resistance.
As a result it was not the war but the post-war era and the
division between the Soviet Union and the US that had the
greatest impact on Latin America. Left to themselves, the
republics of the hemisphere may have been able to build
455on the prosperous trading relations established during the
war years to increase revenues and promote
modernization. Unfortunately, Latin American nations
were not left free of outside interference.

Cuba: Guerrillas Take Power
No event has played a greater role in realigning internal
and external alliances, in reformulating national agendas,
and even in inspiring change in the hemisphere than has
the Cuban Revolution. The events of January 1, 1959 had a
dramatic effect on the US political agenda toward Latin
America, as well as giving birth to a whole new branch of
study in US universities. According to Stanford political
science professor Richard Fagen, no one did more than
Fidel Castro to promote the study of Latin America in
academic and government circles. Ironically, it is to Castro
and the Cuban Revolution that generations of US scholars
working on Latin America owe their jobs.
Even before the 1959 revolution put Cuba more squarely
on the international map, the island was a major
contributor to worldwide culture, politics, letters, and
economics. For what might seem a tiny producer for the
commodity chain, Cuba’s output in the years before, and
continuing after, the Revolution has been tremendous:
major innovations in music, art, dance, literature, and
political theory, not to mention rum, cigars, and baseball
players. The rumba, cha cha, and mambo all originated in
Cuba, as did salsa, the most recognizably Latin dance.
Salsa developed out of Cuban rumba in the nineteenth
century and, largely as a result of Puerto Rican influence,
captured New York and the rest of the world in the late
twentieth century. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
Cuba was a pioneer in orchestra and symphony music,
opera and modern dance, while current artists, especially
458Silvio Rodríguez (b. 1946), are known throughout Latin
America. Silvio’s protest lyrics intersected with the New
Song movement arising in Chile in the 1960s and have
gone on to have enormous impact on Latin American
protest music in every country. Cuba is, as well, the
birthplace of some the continent’s major authors, poets,
and theorists, including José Martí, Antonio Maceo,
Guillermo Cabrera Enfante (1929–2005), Nicolás Guillén
(1902–89), Alejo Carpentier (1904–80), Fidel Castro,
Reinaldo Arenas (1943–90), artists such as Ana Mendieta
(1948–85), Wifredo Lam (1902–82), and José Bédia (b.
1959), and major prima ballerina and choreographer Alicia
Alonso (b. 1920). Musicians famous in both the US and in
Cuba are too many to name, including singers Benny Moré
(1919–63), Celia Cruz (1925–2003), Israel “Cachao”
López (1918–2008), Arturo Sandoval (b. 1949), Pablo
Milanés (b. 1943), and more.
Cuba has played a disproportionately significant role in the
colonial and post-colonial eras. Its importance is evident in
the splendor of Havana’s architecture, emblematic of the
importance of the city as a colonial-era capital. From the
1930s until the end of the 1950s, however, Havana was a
wide open city where, for a price, most anything was
available, and the wealthy from throughout the world made
it a point to partake. In the heyday of US Prohibition
(1919–33), rum-runners and other members of organized
crime syndicates established a steady business supplying
the speak-easies of the northeastern states with alcohol
from Cuba. When Prohibition was repealed in 1933,
organized crime was well established in Havana, and able
to turn to other forms of lucrative entertainment, including
prostitution, gambling, and drug peddling. Through the
459efforts of a string of military dictators, the most brutal
being Gerardo Machado y Morales (1871–1939) whose
nickname “The Butcher” conveys his particular
governance style, Cuba remained for decades under the
watchful gaze of its powerful northern neighbor. Machado
was overthrown by the Cuban military in 1933 and forced
into exile, eventually in Miami, where six years later he
died. Disliked and distrusted on all sides at the time of his
death, subsequent Cuban governments have refused to
allow his remains to be returned to Cuba for burial.
Similar to the brief democratic experiments in Bolivia and
Guatemala, Cuba also entered a reformist phase in 1934
with the founding of the Auténtico (Authentic) Party under
the leadership of Dr. Ramón Grau (1887–1969), who
oversaw the writing of Cuba’s first genuinely independent
constitution in 1940 and set in place a political reform
program designed to lay the foundation for a democratic
society. Despite the timidity of Grau’s plan, which made
no mention of equalizing pervasive income inequalities, it
provoked heated opposition. US investors, especially
powerful sugar interests, perceived a threat to their power,
while the Cuban left argued that the new constitution did
not go far enough. The latter came together in the
Ortodoxo (Orthodox) Party, whose charismatic leader
Eddie Chibás (1907–51) was a young man with a strong
following among fellow university students and other
activists in Havana. Chibás warned that the 1952 election
would be stolen by the right, and in an effort to draw
attention to widespread corruption in the political process
and the lack of justice in Cuban society, he committed
suicide in 1951 – on the air during his weekly nationwide
radio broadcast. The election was indeed stolen, and
460Fulgencio Batista (1901–73), a member of the Cuban
military, assumed the presidency, a post he held until
January 1, 1959 when he fled the country just as Fidel
Castro Ruz and his 26th of July Movement rolled into
Havana.
“History Will Absolve Me”
Inspired by earlier populist revolutionaries in other parts of
Latin America (having been arrested in Colombia in 1948
while attending an anti-imperialist conference organized
by Jorge Gaitán), Fidel Castro, a young lawyer from a
prosperous planter background, led a small group of
revolutionaries in an unsuccessful attack on the Moncada
military barracks in the southeastern city of Santiago de
Cuba on July 26, 1953. Originally able to flee to the
mountains nearby, Castro and his followers (subsequently
labeled the “26th of July Movement”) were arrested and
brought to trial. Fidel Castro’s defense at his trial on
October 16, 1953 has since become one of the most
famous speeches by a Latin American political leader,
particularly in the challenge delivered in the final line:
“Sentence me. I don’t mind. History will absolve me.” The
young lawyer’s trial had been moved to a hospital ward to
keep it out of the public’s eye, so only a few members of
the court, and medical personnel who stopped by to listen
in, heard the five-hour-long speech delivered (as has
become Castro’s style ever since) from a few pages of
notes. In it the 27-year-old leader of this small group of
youths described the country’s social conditions, and laid
out the justification for taking up arms against the Batista
dictatorship. Between the time of the speech defending the
attack on Moncada in 1953, the group’s subsequent short
461prison term and later exile to Mexico, and the return
invasion of the island in late 1956, both opposition to
Batista and Castro’s popularity had spread. The latter had
accurately articulated the grievances of many Cubans, and
during his three-year absence the “History will absolve
me” speech had been distributed and read. Much of the
success of the Cuban Revolution can be attributed to
widespread dislike of the Batista regime.1
Causes for Discontent
Cuba’s problems were similar to those of other small
countries in the region: sharp income inequalities and lack
of political rights. Nonetheless, Cuba was not like
Guatemala or Bolivia. Instead it had one of the highest
standards of living in Latin America in the 1950s, behind
Argentina and Uruguay. Women had been voting since the
1930s, not long after US women won suffrage, and Havana
had hosted more than one Pan-American conference
promoting women’s rights. Cuba’s universities were some
of the oldest and most prestigious in the Americas, and its
capital city of Havana was a major cosmopolitan center
that attracted mainstream tourists, intellectuals, and artists,
as well as those seeking disreputable entertainment. What
made Cuba ripe for revolution was the combination of
these factors. Income distribution was grossly uneven,
especially between urban and rural areas. Many educated
and sophisticated Cubans were forced to endure
humiliating treatment at the hands of international visitors
and institutions that excluded them. The country was rich,
and many Cubans prospered; however, the political
structure was ridden with corruption, favoritism, and
privileges for foreigners and their companies.
462Castro’s famous speech captured that combination of
grievances, noting that the government served merely to
deliver Cuba’s wealth abroad; for example, 85 percent of
Cuba’s small farmers paid rent to foreign-owned
corporations, including the infamous United Fruit
Company and the West India Company. Most of the land
remained uncultivated, and the small number of factories
engaged in processing food, tobacco, textiles, lumber, and
sugar sent those goods abroad, forcing Cuba to import
even many basic foodstuffs. Particularly humiliating was
the fact that Cuba did not control fishing rights off its
shores, nor possess the ability to use the sea for its own
national benefit. As a result, many in the island nation
went hungry because the wealth of the sea was strictly in
the hands of foreign-owned pleasure boat and fishing
companies. The people who toiled to produce Cuba’s
wealth lacked basic human services; many children died of
preventable maladies such as tapeworms, parasites,
influenza, and dysentery. Castro called for improvements
in education, especially the establishment of schools to
train technicians, engineers, and scientists and thus break
the nation’s dependence on foreign expertise. He noted
that in the rural areas illiteracy, isolation, and ignorance
undermined national unity and any chance that the
majority of Cubans could participate as full citizens.
In addition to the exhaustive list of failings, Castro
outlined his own inspiration for launching a political
movement. He referred to the North American Revolution
against England, to the French Revolution, and to other
movements for reform and revolution that had united and
inspired people abroad. Indicative of his years of education
in Jesuit academies and universities, Castro invoked the
463Enlightenment thinkers, major philosophical movements,
and the right of individuals to seek redress for their
grievances. Repeatedly he came back to José Martí, the
framers of the liberal Constitution of 1940, and other
democratic ideals. There was in the speech no indication
that he was influenced by Marxism; indeed, as a student
Castro had shunned the communists, although his brother,
Raúl Castro Ruz (b. 1931), joined the Communist Party.
“History will absolve me” looked to Martí, not Marx or
Lenin, for its political inspiration. Its genius, and resultant
popularity, rested in the breadth of its perspective: it
addressed the grievances of middle-class intellectuals,
entrepreneurs, and professionals, along with those of
seasonal sugar-cane cutters, illiterate peasants, and urban
factory workers. There has been much debate as to
whether Castro was hiding his leftist agenda in the early
stage of the Revolution or whether he was simply a
political novice. Regardless, his opening salvo, contained
in his most important speech, offered hope to every honest
Cuban patriot in the new society.
The Revolutionary War
Regrouping in Mexico after a general amnesty reduced his
prison term to 18 months, Castro and the 26th of July
Movement encountered a more sophisticated group of
revolutionaries, including Argentine Ernesto “Che”
Guevara and exiles from the Spanish Civil War who had
received asylum in Mexico after the defeat of the
Republican cause in 1939. Armed with both political and
military strategy, the group re-entered Cuba in late 1956,
and, after a rocky start, eventually launched a concerted
struggle that linked guerrilla camps in the mountains with
464organizations operating in the cities, especially among the
trade unions. Frank País (1934–57) mobilized a series of
daring demonstrations in Santiago de Cuba and built an
organization that linked up the underground network in
many cities and towns. Killed on the streets of Santiago
before the Revolution’s victory, País’s skillful work was
instrumental in bringing news of the guerrilla movement to
urban areas, creating constant disruptions that distracted
Batista’s army, and apprehending arms and supplies that
were then distributed to the guerrilla camps in the
mountains and throughout the island.
In early 1957 Herbert Matthews (1900–77) interviewed
Fidel Castro in the latter’s camp high in the Sierra Maestra
mountains for a series of stories that appeared in the New
York Times. Much of the world became familiar with
Castro because of Matthews’ sympathetic portrayal of the
charismatic leader and his band of idealistic and
resourceful young combatants. Combined with the failure
of Batista’s counter-insurgency methods and the apparent
unpopularity of the corrupt regime, the US drew back from
supporting the dictatorship. On New Year’s morning of
1959 the dictator, his family, and close associates fled the
country, along with much of the moneyed Cuban elite, and
foreign members of the entertainment, investment, and
business communities, as well as many hundreds of
foreign tourists. The hasty exodus of the wealthy and the
corrupt stood in dramatic contrast with the cheering
populace that lined the streets from Santa Clara to Havana
to greet the guerrillas’ triumphant entry into Havana a
week later.
465Although the fighting had at times been intense, the
revolutionary war was not the proving ground for the new
society; that would unfold over the subsequent years. In
recognition of the unpopularity of Batista’s government
and in hopes of maneuvering to bring the new regime
under its wing, Washington immediately recognized the
new government. But within two years the relationship
between the two countries had deteriorated completely.
Similar to events in Guatemala and Bolivia earlier in the
decade, and in Mexico at the zenith of its revolution, the
main areas of contention with the United States developed
when the revolutionary government instituted a land
reform, including expropriation of estates and US-owned
properties. In response to pressure from the sugar trusts, as
well as in retaliation against the requirement that
US-owned oil refineries in Cuba agree to process all crude
oil in the country – whether bought from US companies or
not – President Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations
in the last days of his administration. It was, however,
under John Kennedy’s (1917–63) presidency that the most
acute tensions emerged between the two nations, initiated
by the bungled invasion on April 17, 1961 at Playa Girón
(Bay of Pigs) and culminating a year and a half later
during what came to be known as the “Cuban Missile
Crisis.”
A joint effort between the CIA (many of whom were
veterans of the 1954 Guatemalan coup) and anti-Castro
Cuban exiles, the Bay of Pigs invasion was from start to
finish a poorly conceived operation. It proved
embarrassing to the US, only serving to validate Cuba’s
claim that the tiny island was the victim of latter-day “Big
Stick diplomacy” and, most importantly, it forced Cuba to
466turn to the Soviet Union for protection. Already in the
works under Eisenhower, the invasion was founded on the
faulty premise that the Cuban populace would rise up to
greet the invaders. In fact, quite the opposite occurred and
the small island nation rallied to the government’s defense
– especially when Castro was able to parade captured
military officers from Batista’s army before the Cuban
public. The disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion was only
the most widely known failure among many attempts to
bring down the Cuban regime, ranging from other, less
high-profile, invasions; botched schemes to assassinate
Fidel Castro (including explosive cigars, food poisonings,
etc.); sabotage against crops, especially the delicate
tobacco plants; to the longstanding embargo that prevents
both trade with and travel to Cuba.
None of these efforts succeeded in deposing the Cuban
government – and many might argue that they have been
counter-productive, serving to bolster Castro’s reputation
among other Latin American nations and radical youth;
isolating and demoralizing some reformers within Cuba;
and probably intensifying Castro’s popularity among
hardliners resistant to broader democracy. Thus the Cuban
government has been able to use the David versus Goliath
scenario to its advantage, refusing to discuss persistent
criticisms in the area of human rights. The blatant
aggression of the Bay of Pigs invasion provided an entrée,
or perhaps an excuse, for Cuba to turn more decidedly
toward the Soviet camp. Castro declared Cuba a
Marxist-Leninist state, and the centrist, bourgeois phase of
the revolution ended. In October 1962 Cuba’s decision to
install Soviet nuclearpowered missiles – ostensibly to
defend itself from further US attacks – precipitated one of
467the most intense crises of the Cold War. For 13 days in
October the world stood at the brink of nuclear war
between the reigning superpowers, as the two sides
attempted to defuse the tension without losing face.
Ultimately the standoff was ended in an agreement
between Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev (1894–1971)
and President Kennedy; Castro was relegated to the
sidelines. The US promised never again to invade Cuba,
and to withdraw missiles from Turkey aimed at Moscow,
while the Soviets withdrew the missiles from Cuba.
Although a key moment in Cuban history, the October
1962 crisis is actually most memorable as the event that
solidified the world into the two superpowers’ spheres of
influence. For years afterward, the US proffered only
rhetorical opposition to Soviet repression in Eastern
Europe, while the Soviets extended heated condemnation
of US policies, but tepid concrete assistance to Latin
American struggles for self-determination. The exception
was Cuba, which after the early 1960s entered fully into
the orbit of the communist bloc, became a key trading
partner with the USSR and Eastern Europe, and depended
on the Soviets for millions of dollars in economic aid. In
return, Cuba became one of the Soviet Union’s most
reliable allies in the subsequent Cold War battles.
Undeniably, the Revolution’s accomplishments since 1959
in terms of social services, if not participatory democracy,
are impressive. On a continent where democratic
experiments have been short-lived, precariously balanced
between military coups and rule by local strongmen, the
most undemocratic feature has been grinding poverty,
malnutrition, illiteracy, disease, crime, and corruption. In
sharp contrast, Cuba has ensured basic health and
468wellbeing for every citizen. Education through to
university level, medical care, complete freedom of choice
in abortion and birth control, social security, child care,
maternity leave, rent, and many social services are free, or
nearly so. Women were mobilized from the earliest days of
the Revolution and obtained rights unparalleled in Latin
America – or most of the world – such as the 1975 Cuban
Family Code, whereby discrimination against women and
girls, even within the family structure, was outlawed.
During periods of hardship and contraction, such as the
early 1990s, when subsidies from the Soviet Union ended,
the maintenance of social services often fell back on
women as mothers, wives, and caregivers, indicative that
Cuba had not fully equalized gender responsibilities. Yet it
must be noted that only a few northern European
democracies have even attempted to enforce such strict
gender equality. Through the Federation of Cuban Women
(FMC), one of the foremost mass organizations established
after the Revolution’s triumph, the government has been
able to closely monitor women’s progress and ensure
oversight. Women have achieved impressive parity in
university education, pay scales, and local government
positions; however, they hold only one-quarter of
high-level administrative positions in government.
The political gains of women, or lack thereof, were
apparent in the speculation over who was to succeed Fidel
Castro as head of state, when he became ill in 2006. Of the
12 to 15 names mentioned, which include the inner circles
of Cuba’s leadership, not one was a woman. The most
prominent woman in the government was FMC founder
Vilma Espín (1930–2007), a member of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party and the party’s
469Political Bureau. Although capable, her appointment could
not have been hurt by the fact that she was married to Raúl
Castro, Fidel’s brother. A chemical engineer with a degree
from MIT, Espín left a life of comfort as the daughter of a
Bacardi Rum executive to work with Frank País in
Santiago in the early days of the guerrilla movement and
clearly had independent leadership credentials. Feminist
critics in Cuba have argued that she was reluctant to
demarcate a path of women’s autonomy independent from
the prevailing view of the Party. Essentially, it is difficult
to say what motivated Espín or any other leader, since one
of the main problems of the Cuban system is lack of
transparency.
There was one head of state, Fidel Castro, from 1959 until
2006, when his brother Raúl assumed power after the elder
Castro suffered a stroke. In February 2008 Fidel Castro
surrendered his position and Raúl was elected president the
following week. This lack of substantive change in
leadership is bound to take a toll, even if apologists for the
system argue that the Castros are enormously popular with
the majority of Cubans. The media is carefully censored
and the ability to print criticisms, to speak openly, and to
meet in opposition to the government is limited.
Opposition to one-party rule has erupted periodically but
the ability of Cubans to obtain refuge in the US has served
to mitigate against internal dissent. Ironically, the fanatical
wing of the Cuban exile community has little interest in
supporting freedom for dissenting views among its own
ranks. Attempts by cultural and political groups to
normalize relations with Cuba usually meets vociferous,
even violent, opposition from hardliners. Dissenting views
470are offen as censored among exiles in Miami as they are in
Cuba, sometimes more so.
The Special Period in Peacetime
Like other Latin American countries, Cuba has long
depended on the export of a single crop: sugar. When the
Soviet Union dissolved in the early 1990s, Cuba overnight
lost access to 75 percent of its imports, over 90 percent of
its external market, untold millions in financial assistance,
and, most importantly, more than 90 percent of the crude
oil it had exchanged for sugar at a highly favorable rate.
From 1991 until 1996 Cuba’s standard of living
plummeted, food shortages were widespread, the highly
mechanized agricultural system stood paralyzed, and the
absence of pharmaceuticals and vaccines threatened the
nation’s health. Nonetheless, Cuba weathered this era,
called the “special period in time of peace,” with little
discernible fall in health, literacy, and life expectancy
statistics. Indicative of the island’s income equality,
everyone lost about 20 pounds of weight, regardless of
occupation, status, or relationship to the center of power
and wealth. By century’s end, economic growth was
returning, based on an aggressive campaign to attract
European and Canadian tourism, a turn toward sustainable,
pesticide-free, organic farming learned from Australian
agronomists, an oil-for-sugar exchange with Venezuela
promoted by socialist ally President Hugo Chávez, a
healthy influx of investment from European Union nations,
especially Spain, and a remarkable level of ingenuity and
perseverance on the part of the Cuban people.
471Critics of US policy argue that the continued embargo suits
only the hard-line anti-Castro faction of South Florida, and
has hurt the US by cutting it off from a ready market for
capital investment and agricultural goods. Oddly, since
2003 the US has been the main supplier of food to Cuba,
sent under a special provision that allows food sales. In
addition, members of the US Congress, including a fair
number of conservative Republicans from the Midwest
agricultural heartland, have traveled to Cuba to promote
bilateral trade. Over the last five years Cuba has purchased
$1.5 billion in food and related products from the US,
including chicken, wheat, corn, rice, and soybeans. Since
Cuba pays in cash, many politicians from farm states are
anxious to expand the trading relationship, as is Cuba. Yet
the economic and social transformation of the 1990s has
taken a toll on socialist principles. Attracting tourists has
meant pouring money into luxury hotels and
foreigners-only resorts, forcing decision makers to devote
a larger proportion of Cuban resources to serve foreigners.
Prostitution has re-emerged after having all but
disappeared after 1959, highly educated professionals have
given up jobs in medicine or academia to work in the more
lucrative tourist trade, and many critics argue that Cuba is
reverting to the bawdy pre-revolution days.
Cuba and the World
Cubans still brave the dangerous 90-mile passage to land
on US shores, where, for domestic political reasons, they
enjoy special privileges accorded no other refugees: instant
citizenship, welfare, and social benefits. Highly prized
baseball players such as José Canseco and Liván and
472Orlando Hernández have defected to sign for multi-million
dollar contracts with the Major Leagues.
In 1980 thousands of Cubans left in a series of boatlifts out
of the port of Mariel destined for South Florida after the
Carter Administration opened access for Cuban-Americans
to visit the island. Cuban-Americans flooded the island
bringing presents, money, and verbal enticements to their
relatives in Cuba. As a result, many of the “Marielitos,” as
they were called, jumped at the opportunity to join family
members already in the US, while others were attracted by
the easy refugee policy and promise of a more materially
rewarding life. In retaliation for the embarrassing exodus,
Castro allowed prisoners and people with mental
disabilities to leave, much to the consternation of the US
customs agents. The Mariel Boatlift from April to October
1980 proved that Cuba was not an island paradise and that
many people wanted to emigrate. Yet if the border were
opened for any country of Latin America, or the
developing world, and its citizens were allowed to enter
the US freely and become instant citizens, many hundreds
of thousands would do so. The appeal of a better life in a
rich country has always been a powerful magnet. For the
time being, the status quo between Cuba and the outside
seems to be in place, and will most likely remain that way
until significant changes take place in US or Cuban
leadership.
As regards its role in the rest of the world, the more the
United States sabotaged, opposed, undermined, and
isolated the tiny nation, the more other nations openly or
begrudgingly admired it. Speaking of Cuba in its heyday
during the 1970s, Mexican politician and writer Jorge
473Castañeda contends: “Cuba’s activities abroad made the
humiliated isle of the Platt Amendment and the
whorehouses of Havana a player on the world stage. It was
reviled by Washington, resented by Moscow, but
respected, indeed admired and revered, throughout the
Third World.”2 The United Nations General Assembly
votes overwhelmingly against the United States’
commercial embargo of Cuba in a yearly non-bonding
resolution. In November 2005, the 182-to-4 tally left the
United States joined only by Israel, the Marshall Islands,
and Palau, with one abstention, Micronesia. Cuba severed
diplomatic ties with Israel in 1973 at the time of the Yom
Kippur War, when Cuba’s offer of safe haven for
Palestinian combatants and support for Palestine left the
two nations at odds; however, private tours of Cuban Jews
to Israel persist, as do excursions sponsored by
Jewish-American organizations. The Israeli flag flies at
Havana’s José Martí Airport, along with those of other
nations. Outside the airport one can see a construction
project operated by an Israeli company, and outside the
city there is a joint Israeli–Cuban agricultural cooperative.
This peculiar relationship parallels the contradictory stance
of many US citizens toward Cuba. An estimated 2 million
international tourists travel to Cuba yearly, at least 250,000
of whom are US citizens who visit the island in defiance of
the embargo; since 1999, governors, senators, and
members of Congress from at least 30 states have traveled
to Cuba. The largest source of “foreign aid” to Cuba
probably comes out of South Florida, in the form of dollars
sent clandestinely by Cuban-Americans to their relatives in
the homeland. In 2009 President Barack Obama (b. 1961)
lifted the Bush-era ban and allowed Cuban-Americans to
474travel from the US to Cuba. Many political observers
assume that one day all travel restrictions will be lifted.
Ernesto “Che” Guevara
The best-known face of the 26th of July Movement was
not a Cuban at all, but a young, bearded Argentine:
Ernesto “Che” Guevara. His image, made famous in a
photograph snapped by Alberto Díaz Gutiérrez, known as
Alberto Korda (see Box 11.1), or simply “Korda”
(1928–2001), has come to personify the romantic
revolutionary icon (Figure 11.1). It graces the walls of
college dorms, the stages of rock and roll bands and
Broadway musicals, is a ubiquitous presence at political
rallies across the globe, crops up in cartoons and television
shows, adorns T-shirts, and enjoys a status accorded to few
other symbols of popular culture. Art critics have labeled it
the “most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of
the twentieth century” (Maryland Institute College of Art).
Figure 11.1 Ernesto “Che” Guevara. (Alberto Korda
photo)
475Che Guevara joined up with Fidel Castro and the other
members of the 26th of July Movement in Mexico several
years after leaving his native Argentina. Already
embracing socialism, and more radical than Castro in his
strategy for bringing about revolutionary change, Che had
476witnessed the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in
1954. He developed the idea of the “new man and woman”
(originally it was only “the new man”) and called for a
profound cultural transformation from the individualist
Enlightenment-based principles Castro invoked in his
“History will absolve me” speech, to those of mutual
giving and sharing in a society motivated by moral
incentives rather than material rewards. As with Mao
Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China, the idealism
proved unworkable in Cuba, although it did not result in
the widespread starvation or political purges that occurred
in China. Cuba abandoned strict moral incentives in all but
rhetoric by the late 1960s, at a time that coincided with
Guevara’s departure from Cuba (a coincidence that has led
to widespread speculation, but no real proof, that there was
a falling out between the two main figures of the
Revolution).
Box 11.1 Alberto Korda and the photo that
launched an international icon
On March 5, 1960, at a commemoration for the
death of 80–100 people who were killed when a
French freighter, La Coubre, exploded in Havana
harbor (allegedly due to CIA sabotage), a Cuban
fashion photographer turned journalist of the
Revolution, Alberto Korda, snapped a single
photograph of Che Guevara as the young guerrilla
joined a line of other leaders of the Revolution
flanking Fidel Castro on a platform at the
477cemetery. Korda’s photo, taken with a Leica
camera using Kodak Plus-X film, captured a single
image of Che staring into the distance, framed by
his long hair and wearing a beret studded with a
single star. Although Korda kept a small cropped
print for himself, he did not publish it, possibly
because on the same roll were photos of Jean-Paul
Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and it was the
famous French philosophers in attendance at the
service whose images appeared in the news
accounts of the event.
The photo of Guevara remained unpublished and in
Korda’s possession, tacked to the wall of his
apartment for the next seven years. At the time of
Che Guevara’s death in Bolivia on October 9,
1967, an Italian poster publisher, Giangiacomo
Feltrinelli, obtained the original landscape-format
negative, cropped Che’s Cuban compatriots from
either side of him, and published it on a poster.
Korda’s image of the Argentine-born martyr
rapidly became a symbol for the emerging
worldwide student revolt. In 1968 Irish artist Jim
Fitzpatrick produced and distributed a
high-contrast print of a drawing that slightly
modified the original image, so that Che’s eyes are
gazing toward the distant horizon, conveying a
heroic impression of a man looking upward and
toward the future.
478Korda never asked for royalties on the photo and
only once intervened to prevent its use – in 2000
when Smirnoff Vodka attempted to use it on an
advertisement. A lifelong communist, Korda
maintained that “as a supporter of the ideals for
which Che Guevara died, I am not averse to its
reproduction by those who wish to propagate his
memory and the cause of social justice throughout
the world, but I am categorically against the
exploitation of Che’s image for the promotion of
products such as alcohol, or for any purpose that
denigrates the reputation of Che.” Korda won an
out-of-court settlement of about $50,000, which he
donated to the Cuban medical system. Since
Korda’s death in 2001, there has been no one to
object to any use of the Che image, capitalist,
socialist, or otherwise. Nonetheless, despite its
widespread reproduction on every product
imaginable, Che’s face yet persists as one of the
most famous international revolutionary icons.
El Che, as he was known, set out to reproduce the guerrilla
movements’ triumph, first in the African Congo and later
in the mountains of Bolivia. Drawing on French
philosopher Regis Debray’s (b. 1941) guerrilla warfare
strategy, which he termed focoismo, Che argued that the
Latin American hemisphere was ripe for socialist
revolution, that the conditions for a socialist insurrection
could be accelerated by a small band of armed militants
drawn tightly together under disciplined leadership.
479Instead of opting for the clandestine armed struggle as a
last resort, when conditions prohibited an above-ground
movement, the foco formula envisioned the opposite: the
emergence and proliferation of mass organizations as a
result of armed actions by a covert revolutionary cadre. In
this regard Che’s view broke decisively with – rather than
simply ignoring, as had been the strategy of Cuba’s 26th of
July Movement – the Moscow-oriented Latin American
communist parties and with the conventional wisdom of
Marxist-Leninist theory.
Guevara chose the Bolivian Altiplano to test this theory,
bringing together a tightly knit group of Cubans, an East
German woman with the code name Tania, and a few
urban-based Bolivian and Peruvian communists. The plan
failed miserably. In 1967 Bolivian rangers, trained and
supplied by the US Special Forces, captured, executed, and
buried Guevara in an unknown grave, after sending to the
press a photo of his tortured and emaciated body. When
news of his death reached radicals and social activists in
Latin America, and the student movement abroad, Che was
elevated to hero status, regardless of the failure of his
ill-conceived plan or that the very peasants they hoped to
incite betrayed the rag-tag outsiders to the Bolivian army.
As noted earlier in this chapter, Che and his followers did
not speak the native Quechua language and thus could not
communicate their aims, nor did they understand that the
peasantry had recently won an important reform during the
1952 Bolivian Revolution. Moreover, it was Bolivia’s
miners, with whom Che had no contact, who were actually
the most revolutionary stratum of the highland proletariat.
Nevertheless, youthful groups of revolutionaries
throughout Latin America and in the developed and
480developing world read his works, adopted his strategy, and
attempted to reproduce the success of Cuba, rather than the
failure of Bolivia, in their own homelands.
What Difference Did the Revolution Make?
Despite the myriad problems Cuba faced, its obvious
dependence on the Soviet Union and consequent obedience
to the Moscow line, the tiny island offered hope to young
radicals in many parts of Latin America (Figure 11.2). Not
only had it overthrown an entrenched dictatorship, it had
succeeded in the very shadow of the US itself. Moreover,
Cuba was willing to provide advice, assistance, safe haven,
and refuge, even rest and relaxation, to revolutionaries
struggling to bring about social change or to overthrow
their own repressive governments. Castañeda, in his
admired and vilified book, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin
American Left after the Cold War, attributes the respect
Cuba earned to the vision of Fidel Castro and the genius of
his longtime friend and head of internal security, Manuel
Piñeiro Losada (1934–98). Piñeiro trained the young men,
his “muchachos,” as he called them, who infiltrated abroad
and schooled at home a whole generation of revolutionary
recruits for the Latin American guerrilla movement.
Piñeiro, a contemporary of Fidel’s from a prominent
Havana family, attended Columbia University, where it
was assumed he would study business and make the
connections to follow in his father’s footsteps as an
executive with Bacardi Rum. Rejecting his roots and
opting for the revolution, the charismatic, beguiling, and
attractive red-bearded Piñeiro is credited with building an
impenetrable security structure in Cuba and directing
insurgencies throughout the hemisphere in what Castañeda
481calls “the most heroic chapter in its history.” Castañeda, a
critic of the guerrilla strategy, an advisor to conservative
Mexican president Vicente Fox, and a man who has ruffled
many feathers with his argument that Fidelismo was
ultimately neither productive nor in the best interest of
social change in Latin America, nonetheless admired the
project Cuba attempted. Castañeda’s conclusions, despite
hints of paternalistic sentimentality, are nonetheless worth
pondering:
Piñeiro and the Revolution’s attempts to fan the fires of
revolt across Latin America began as the most heroic
chapter in its history. From the earliest guerrilla landings
in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic to Che’s
sacrifice in Bolivia, not to mention the countless Cubans
who fought, or helped others fight, in guerrilla wars
extending over three decades, Fidel’s vision of a revolution
that had to be exported included some of its finest hours:
generous, idealistic, unselfish. In the brief moments of
victory or success, and during the long years of defeat and
retribution, the Cubans stood by their friends, cared for the
widows, orphans, and maimed who survived the
hemisphere’s Thirty Years Wars. They opened their doors
to many who had nowhere else to go and gave much of the
best of themselves and their experience to bringing change
in Latin America. One may disagree with the tactics, or
even with the goals, but they pursued both with
perseverance and dignity.3
Figure 11.2 Near the Plaza de la Revolución. The
billboard marking the 44th anniversary of the Revolution
features Fidel Castro and Camilo Cienfuego, heroes of the
revolutionary war. Camilo died in battle, Fidel went on to
482lead the country. The billboard depicts the mass of Cubans
as patriotic, hardworking, and peace loving, cheering
amidst a sea of flags, machetes, and doves. On the street in
front of the billboard, a pre-1959 US automobile in
remarkably pristine condition stands as an ironic symbol of
revolutionary Cuba’s conflicted relationship with the
United States. (Martin Benjamin photo)
So long as Cuba existed, there was no such thing as
non-alignment among the Latin American nations. The
OAS (Organization of American States) was founded in
1948 with headquarters on the Mall in Washington DC,
alongside the Museum of American History and the
National Archives. It was not an institution that
symbolically or realistically stood for national sovereignty.
Cuba was expelled after the revolution and the beginning
of disagreements with the US. More importantly, every
other state of the Americas was required for the next 30
years to break diplomatic ties with Cuba or risk expulsion
as well. To paraphrase the English historian Eric
483Hobsbawm, as the “iron grille of the Cold War was
clamped across the globe” nearly every state in the world
was required to join one or the other system of alliances.
With the single exception of Mexico, no country in the
OAS that wanted to stay on good terms with the US could
also be friendly with Cuba throughout the Cold War, while
the mere mention of Fidel Castro in the inner circles of a
Latin American government was rumored to be enough to
bring in the CIA and initiate a covert action against a
leader.
Democratic Shortcomings
Despite the many social reforms since the Revolution, the
Cuban government has never allowed widespread
democratic freedoms, including freedom of the press, of
assembly, and the right to mobilize opposition to
government policies. While many countries have official,
government-sponsored, news agencies, Cuba’s media is
controlled and censored. This is not to say that alternative
views are entirely absent, especially in movies and books,
but a capricious level of control prohibits the existence of a
culture of freedom. Curbs on freedom of expression have
driven many in the artistic, literary, and academic
community to abandon Cuba. The most celebrated case
was that of Reinaldo Arenas (1943–90), a talented writer,
poet, and playwright, who suffered persecution for
refusing to submit to self-censorship in what he wrote and
to curb his openly homosexual lifestyle. Arenas’s 1992
autobiography, Before Night Falls (which was later made
into a movie after the author’s death from AIDS in New
York), graphically recounts the physical and mental
repression he suffered at the hands of the Cuban
484authorities. However, Arenas might find Cuba much
altered today. Mariela Castro Espín (b. 1962), daughter of
Raúl Castro and Vilma Espín, leads the Cuban National
Center for Sex Education, an organization devoted to
promoting acceptance of Cuba’s LGBT (lesbian/gay/
bisexual/transgender) community. As a result of the
center’s work and other initiatives, tolerance for same-sex
relationships and the openly gay lifestyle has changed
dramatically, to the point that gay-oriented travel guides
list Havana as one of the world’s gay-friendly cities.
Cuban officials blame the US embargo and the persistence
of Cuban exile counterinsurgency campaigns for the lack
of freedom, stating that the need to repel invasions from
the outside has prevented the government from lifting the
surveillance of its own people. Undoubtedly that is
partially true; however, it is also clear that Cuba has
evolved its own “culture of censorship” over the last near
50 years. On the one hand, censorship has allowed
corruption to spread, since open investigation, organized
opposition, and freedom of expression are key tools for
rooting out favoritism, inefficiency, and graft. On the other
hand, US hostility toward the regime has prevented
reasonable dialogue on future relations between the two
nations. The US has been a powerful enemy, no one can
doubt, but Cuban officials have also used that enmity to
enforce allegiance and conformity with the prevailing
party line, often at a high cost to the intellectual, cultural,
and social life of its people.
Conclusion
485The 1959 overthrow of Cuba’s Fulgencio Batista, one of
Washington’s closest allies in the region, shocked
diplomatic circles on both sides of the Caribbean.
Although Trujillo’s machinations in the Dominican
Republic might have been an occasional thorn in
Washington’s side, up to that point the US had been able
to manage the embarrassing and potentially unfavorable
press resulting from its relationship with one or another
authoritarian regime. That all changed when Fidel Castro’s
bearded guerrilla army marched into Havana on January 1,
1959, unleashing a series of revolutionary or reform
movements in several countries.
Cuba’s successful revolution had a dramatic effect on the
rest of the hemisphere. Populations that had waited
patiently (or not so patiently) to share in their nations’
wealth and witness a leveling of gross inequalities, or
whose hopes had been raised by reform governments
subsequently overthrown by traditional elites, military or
external (mainly US) forces, drew renewed inspiration
from the band of young men, and a few women, who
toppled an entrenched dictatorship the US had long
supported. The Cuban Revolution turned back the dismal
cycle in which Latin American nations seemed to be
caught, which prominent Mexican novelist and political
commentator Carlos Fuentes (b. 1928) calls the ultimate
Catch 22:
We start a democratic process, such as the one that took
place in Guatemala in the forties and fifties, such as the
one that took place in Chile in the seventies, and it is
promptly destroyed, promptly intervened, and promptly
corrupted by the same people who create the illusion that
486Latin Americans are incapable of governing themselves. If
there has ever been a Catch 22 in history, it is this one.4

Progress and Reaction
By the late twentieth century Latin America had grown
immensely; its population increased from 61 million in
1900 to 200 million in 1968. Ten cities, spanning the
region from south to north – Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro,
São Paulo, Recife, Santiago, Lima, Caracas, Bogotá,
Mexico City, and Havana – already had more than one
million inhabitants, and the region was becoming the most
urbanized in the world. Class differences were apparent in
cities, where a prosperous middle class was emerging, but
the rising tide was not lifting all boats. The majority of
laborers earned wages that kept them in persistent poverty;
recent migrants from the countryside crowded into
shantytowns mushrooming on the cities’ outskirts. From
the early 1960s until 1990, Latin America was one of the
most turbulent regions on the world’s political stage.
Tensions pitted armed, nationalist movements for
self-determination – generally influenced, if not fully
guided, by socialist, anti-imperialist ideas – against
pro-capitalist, multinational business interests loyal to
landowning oligarchies, the military, and commercial
elites. A variety of groups, political parties, and social
movements embarked on a range of strategies to enact
change. Although some movements for political and
economic change turned to armed struggle, others sought
to bring about reform through the electoral arena.
Modernization and Progress
488Mexico, the only country, apart from Cuba, to have
undertaken a prolonged social revolution in the twentieth
century, fell into bureaucratic complacency that left social
inequality intact, even at the cost of violently repressing
dissent. The Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM,
Partido de la Revolución Mexicano) changed its name in
1946 to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, Partido
Revolucionario Institucional), with “institutional” the
operative word. Although nominally a member of the
Socialist International, the PRI no longer represented the
socialist labor movement, intellectuals, and agrarian
reformers, except through rhetorical flourishes every six
years during presidential campaigns. The PRI had become
a party of technocrats and bureaucrats; economists trained
at the Harvard Business School and other graduates of
North American MBA programs; entrepreneurs,
professionals, and members of the expanding middle class.
Its goals were prosperity and stability, to be achieved
through traditional capitalist channels. In contrast to Cuba,
which the US continually berated for lack of a “two-party
system” that mimicked its own, Washington was
unconcerned that Mexico’s PRI made little pretense of
sharing power. Like the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan
and India’s Congress Party, the PRI emerged from the
post-World War II era as a monolith that shifted electoral
offices back and forth among competing factions of little
ideological difference. Although sporadic violence, strikes,
and peasant, student and worker protests usually met with
severe repression from police and military forces –
especially in 1968 – Mexico experienced no repeat of the
turbulence that marked the early decades of the twentieth
century.
489In other areas of Latin America, especially the Southern
Cone, tensions between left and right dominated politics
during the 1960s and 1970s. The 1964 military coup in
Brazil, followed by years of censorship, dismantling of
activist forces in trade unions, community organizations,
universities, and religious orders, was the opening salvo in
a string of dictatorships that enveloped the region for
decades. Brazil’s military junta drew the blueprint for what
came to be known as the “National Security Regime,” a
particular form of authoritarianism characterized by
systematic surveillance of the civilian population,
combined with the use of torture and disappearance against
sometimes randomly selected suspects, to instill
widespread fear and compliance.
At this time the US government, working largely through
the CIA, sought to ensure that Latin American allies
followed a staunch anti-communist, pro-US business
agenda. As a result, even moderate governments with little
affection for communism and the Soviet Union, who were
merely interested in a neutral stance regarding the two
superpowers or who wanted to maintain diplomatic ties
with Cuba, became the object of CIA intervention,
resulting in a string of military coups stretching from
Brazil in 1964 to Chile and Uruguay in 1973, and
Argentina in 1976. The CIA maintained a base of
operations in Panama and a Southern Command
Headquarters in Paraguay, a country that all too well
illustrated the results of maintaining a close alliance with
the US. Paraguay had barely been rebuilt since the
genocidal War of Triple Alliance (1865–70); it languished
under the 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo
Stroessner (1912–2006). A staunch ally of the US,
490Stroessner ruled from 1954 to 1989, during which time he
brooked no opposition, under penalty of torture and death,
while presiding over a people with one of the lowest
income and literacy levels, and highest infant mortality
rates, in the hemisphere.
Brazil’s Military Coup
The chain of events that led the military to intervene in
1964 against the democratically designated president João
Goulart (1919–76) resembled events in Guatemala in the
early 1950s. Like Juan Arévalo, Janio Quadros (1917–92)
won the presidency in 1961 on the basis of promises to
take a neutral stance in foreign policy, increase
manufacturing and overall industrial growth, lay the
groundwork for a broader participatory democracy, and
take up the issue of land reform. Communist-inspired
Peasant Leagues under the leadership of Francisco Julião
(1915–99) were demanding equitable distribution of land
and higher wages for rural workers in a massive campaign
that penetrated 13 of Brazil’s then 22 states (currently 26).
The Peasant Leagues, or ligas, pursued a number of
strategies, encouraging peasants to seize unoccupied land,
and uniting rural workers into trade unions through which
they demanded higher wages, better living conditions, and
regulated hours. Operating under the slogan “land reform
by law or by force,” the ligas were prepared to take up
arms to win demands if peaceful tactics failed.
Agitation in the early 1960s was not limited to land issues,
nor were the ligas the only activists. Members of the
Catholic clergy, supported by activist bishops, urban trade
unionists, students, and professionals were increasingly
491vocal in calling for schooling and medical care for the
urban and rural poor, decent wages and improved access to
water, roads, public transportation, and other services
needed to guarantee a better quality of life for the majority
of the country’s citizens. Conditions at home, combined
with the example of the Cuban Revolution, inspired a
generation of young Brazilian activists to replicate the
socialist revolution that was claiming to bring equality to
Cuba. Reminiscent of the chain of events in Guatemala,
Quadros’s timid responses to agitation from the left met
with heated opposition from conservative landowners,
industrialists, and politicians. In a land where powerful
rural bosses had exerted unchecked raw force since
colonial times (a situation immortalized in the tales of
Brazil’s foremost novelist, Jorge Amado), attempts to
impose even moderate reforms met with outrage. They
called on their allies in the military and police to crush
rural workers, small landowners, and impoverished
peasants who occupied disputed landholdings. In a gamble
that backfired, the beleaguered Quadros resigned after only
a year in office, speculating that he would be reinstated
since the prospect of the more radical vice-president, João
Goulart, becoming president would be completely
unacceptable to hard-line conservatives. Quadros
miscalculated, however, and Goulart, with the backing of a
group of powerful politicians, became president in August
1961.
From the very first days rumors of a military takeover
swirled around Goulart’s presidency, serving as a powerful
brake on the few reforms the government hoped to enact.
The rural oligarchy’s refusal to consider agrarian reform
was joined by business interests in Brazil and in the United
492States who viewed the political situation as unstable,
especially when Goulart’s closest political ally, Leonel
Brizola (1922–2004), the governor of Rio Grande do Sul,
nationalized a subsidiary of International Telephone and
Telegraph (IT&T). Multinational companies interested in
reaping high profits counted on a docile workforce that
would tolerate meager wages and abysmal working
conditions, on a government that offered favorable tariff
agreements, low taxes, and lax enforcement of health and
safety laws. In the US, the Lyndon Johnson administration
was less than pleased. In an era of intense Cold War
rivalry between the US and the communist world,
exacerbated by the successful Cuban Revolution and
widening conflict in Southeast Asia, the US distrusted any
political leader who sought to maintain a middle ground or
spoke of even moderate reform. Vice-President Goulart
had traveled to China (and was there when Quadros
resigned), which angered a US State Department that
considered any attempt by Latin American governments to
forge a non-aligned foreign policy as contrary to US
interests; friendly relations with “Red” China were out of
the question. Finally, Goulart’s mismanagement of state
affairs and hesitancy in dealing with a considerable
opposition made his term in office precarious from the
start.
In early 1964 the expected began to unfold. On March 31
troops under the command of General Olimpio Mourão
Filho (1900–72) marched on the federal capital in Rio de
Janeiro, setting the coup into motion. Other branches of the
military joined within hours and, under the leadership of
General Humberto Castello Branco (1900–67), deposed
the legal government. João Goulart flew into exile in
493Uruguay, where he lived until dying of a heart attack in
1976. Many initially greeted the military intervention
enthusiastically, including most of the media, the hierarchy
of the Catholic Church, the business and political elite, and
even a group of prosperous women who believed that
Goulart’s policies had caused prices to climb and granted
their maids too many rights. On the other hand, some
sectors that greeted the coup warmly, in hopes that it
would halt rampant inflation and instability, drew back as
the full force of the military’s repression, especially the
arrest and torture of thousands of citizens, unfolded. The
US promptly recognized the military regime and set about
negotiating a generous military and economic aid package.
This warm relationship continued through the string of
dictators that ruled Brazil from 1964 until the return of
democracy in 1988, despite the regime’s widely publicized
human rights violations.
The National Security State
For the working class, the rural and urban poor, the
landless, homeless, and illiterate, as well as democratic
forces, the coup was a severe setback. The 1964 coup
d’état ushered in a new type of military regime. Rather
than a government based on the politics of personal
clientelism and corruption, the new regime adopted a
bureaucratic and institutional military rule. In contrast with
the single, self-interested rule of Rafael Trujillo in the
Dominican Republic, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, or
Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, for example, the Brazilian
model demonstrated an ideological commitment by the full
military bureaucracy to hold power. Beginning in 1964, a
coalition of generals sought to transform both state and
494society, introducing a model of national economic growth
secured within a controlled environment that permitted
virtually no opposition. The national security state evolved
over a number of years. Originally, from 1964 until 1967,
Brazil’s military junta ruled through a series of exceptional
measures without changing the basic structure of the
government. At the same time, they began a process of
rewriting the national constitution. In 1967 a compliant
Congress ratified a new constitution that allowed indirect
elections for president; however, only military leaders
could be candidates. It granted the president the right to
govern through decree, even when the legislature was in
session, effectively eliminating congressional
disagreement or debate. While on paper laws existed to
protect individual rights, they were either not enforced or
constantly nullified by decrees to ensure “national
security.” What began as a “moderate” military
dictatorship in 1964, based on purging the system of
opponents while keeping some institutions of civil society
in operation, turned more repressive in the midst of
growing opposition a few years later.
Latin America’s Youth Movement
In Brazil, and throughout the world, 1968 was a pivotal
year. It began with the “Tet Offensive” – in which the Viet
Cong army shocked the world by demonstrating its ability
to overpower American forces in Saigon, Vietnam – and
continued on as a period marked by student protests in
Paris and many universities in the United States and
Europe, culminating in a bloody massacre of students
before the opening of the Olympic Games in Mexico City.
In Brazil students mounted huge demonstrations against
495the generals, joined by powerful sections of the industrial
working class in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Seeing the
“communist threat” everywhere, fearing the rise of an
opposition movement among workers, intellectuals, and
even some of the traditional elites, and equating any call
for democracy with subversion, the regime cracked down.
Late in 1968 the military began to govern through a series
of institutional acts added to the framework of the
constitution. Institutional Act 2 allowed for indirect
elections, dissolved all existing political parties and
created two new ones: the Brazilian Democratic
Movement Party (PMDB, Partido do Movimento
Democrático Brasileiro) as the opposition party (at least
on paper), and the National Renovating Alliance (ARENA,
Aliança Renovadora Nacional) as the pro-government
party. For so-called crimes against a broadly interpreted
notion of “national security,” Institutional Act 5 suspended
the legislature, forced three Supreme Court judges into
retirement, eliminated many lower court judges, and
suspended habeas corpus (the right to challenge detentions
and imprisonment).
Mexico
In Mexico, ostensibly a democracy and thus unlike Brazil,
students directed their anger at the official party, the PRI.
They decried the failure of the 1910 Revolution to right the
wrongs of society, and noted that despite the half-century
since the Constitution of 1917 a majority of Mexicans and
all but a handful of indigenous people lived in poverty.
They contended that Mexico’s opposition to US
imperialism rang hollow, despite its refusal to join the
US-mandated 1961 OAS boycott of Cuba. The Mexican
496left argued that the PRI maintained diplomatic relations
with Cuba only so long as none of the nation’s social
reforms reached Mexico. In hopes of winning peace at
home and prestige abroad, Mexico launched a full-scale
campaign to host the 1968 Olympics. The effort
succeeded, and despite widespread criticism that
sponsoring the Olympics would deplete valuable resources
needed for social programs, Mexico became the first (and
to date only) Latin American country to host the games. At
a cost of $200 million, an astronomical figure at the time,
Mexico began an ambitious building project in the capital,
including hotels, housing for athletes, tourists, and visiting
dignitaries, massive stadiums and athletic facilities, and
even a new subway system.
Throughout the summer before the games were to open,
unrelated intermittent protests based on inter-school
rivalries, and a few full-scale riots, broke out in Mexico
City high schools. A peaceful demonstration celebrating
the July 26 anniversary of the Cuban Revolution turned
violent when the granaderos (police riot squads)
overreacted in an attempt to disperse the participants. By
August the demonstrations were constant and had spread
to most high schools, as well as the major universities in
Mexico City. Tension mounted as the opening date of the
Olympics grew near and the demonstrations grew in size;
one in the Zócolo, Mexico City’s central plaza, called by
the student strike committee, drew nearly a million people,
making it one of the largest demonstrations in the city’s
history, and certainly the largest protest since the days of
the Revolution. Although centered on student demands, the
protests began to attract supporters from broader sectors of
society, including the working class and even rural
497peasants, who added their own grievances to those of the
students. The police once again met the protests with
extreme violence, bringing in tanks and unleashing the
granaderos, who fired on the crowds. By the end of the
summer, some students had been killed; many had been
beaten and jailed.
The Massacre at Tlateloco
During subsequent months the demonstrations began to die
back; however, a group of militant students called a
demonstration for October 2, 1968 in Tlateloco Plaza in
central Mexico City. The rally at first drew only
5,000–6,000 participants, many of them residents of the
building who stopped to watch on their way home from
work. Also at the plaza were a number of people who were
chatting and socializing, children playing games before the
evening meal, and a number of passers-by, who were
simply in the vicinity. Without warning the police stormed
the building and other police, already posted inside,
opened fire on demonstrators, onlookers, and children
alike. Troops advanced, helicopters circled and dropped
flares. In one of the most shocking shows of force in
Mexican history, hundreds of people were killed outright,
and others died en route to the hospital. Reports that
surfaced later revealed that police pulled the wounded
from ambulances who were trying to take the victims to
hospitals, military vehicles prevented medical personnel
from reaching the wounded, and hospital emergency
rooms near the plaza were invaded by the military, who
dragged bodies back into the street. The government
attempted to dismiss the entire event, claiming that fewer
than 30 people died (observers put the number at between
498300 and 500), that the students initiated the attack, and that
the police and granaderos actually exercised restraint in
the face of wild provocations from the demonstrators.
However, the presence of a large contingent of
international press in the city to cover the Olympics
revealed the true story to the world. Nonetheless, the
Olympics went ahead as scheduled and the government
moved swiftly to cover up the event, which came to be
known as the Massacre at Tlateloco. So long as the PRI
remained in power the 1968 incident was seldom
mentioned.
The PRI’s loss of the presidency in 2000 laid the basis for
a full investigation of the Massacre and of the
disappearance of hundreds of other dissidents during the
1970s. In 2006, two days before the close election that
pitted PAN (National Action Party) candidate Felipe
Calderón (b. 1962) against the leftist PRD (Democratic
Revolutionary Party) candidate, Andrés Manuel Lopéz
Obrador (b. 1953), a judge ordered the arrest of former
president Luis Echeverría (84 years old and ailing), for his
responsibility in the killing of the students in 1968 and the
disappearance and deaths of hundreds more while he was
president from 1970 to 1976. The timing of his arrest led
PRD supporters to argue that the current PAN president,
Vicente Fox, was attempting to win support for Calderón
by showing his ability to get tough on past human rights
violations, and thus turn attention away from criticisms of
his own conservative administration’s record of abuse,
especially against the indigenous population in Oaxaca and
the more remote area of Chiapas.
499Throughout Latin America the experience of the Mexican
students reverberated against a continuing chain of
demonstrations and upheaval. In 1968 the Brazilian
dictatorship entered its most repressive phase. The
institutions of civil society either disappeared or were
restructured; military officers presided over all
universities; student groups were closely monitored; and
many of the country’s leading intellectuals, artists,
musicians, and writers went into exile. In other countries,
however, the intensity of student protests mirrored those
occurring elsewhere throughout the world, and Cuba
remained a beacon of inspiration for revolutionary change,
despite Castro’s embrace of the Soviet Union which was in
turn suppressing pro-democracy activists in
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and other areas of Eastern
Europe. In Latin America the 1970s opened with the
election in Chile of a socialist head of state. Argentina saw
the return, and demise, of Juan Perón, Latin America’s
best-known populist and demagogue, while elsewhere
some of the continent’s most brutal military regimes held
sway. The decade drew to a close with the Sandinistas’
victory in Nicaragua, after a decade of fighting. The late
1960s and 1970s saw Latin American nations traveling
down vastly divergent paths, few of them peaceful.
The Chilean Road to Socialism
Chile, hemmed in as it is by high Andean peaks along its
entire eastern side, is a 4,000-mile-long,
string-bean-shaped country. With a population of just 11
million in the late 1960s, Chile had a limited domestic
market for its own manufactures and agricultural products.
The economy mainly relied on the export of copper from
500mines owned and controlled by Kennecott and Anaconda,
Canadian- and US-based companies. In 1960 the two
mines accounted for 11 percent of the country’s gross
national product, 50 percent of its exports, and 20 percent
of government revenue, pumping $150–200 million a year
into the economy. Despite this heavy reliance on
commodity exports to support internal growth, on the
surface Chile’s economic house appeared stable, though
closer scrutiny revealed otherwise. A key issue was
unemployment and seasonal unemployment, since neither
the landholding system nor the copper mines utilized large
numbers of laborers. Land was used mainly for raising
sheep and cattle, neither of which demanded much care.
With a few farm hands, and the addition of more in the
busy season, ranchers could tend large herds of livestock,
harvest crops, slaughter animals, shear wool, and maintain
their operation.
With so much of Chile’s economy reliant on copper
exports, and the mines controlled by foreign corporations,
the economy was vulnerable to demand fluctuations of the
international commodity chain. During wartime (including
World War II, Korea, and then the Vietnam War) copper
prices were high, since it is an essential mineral used in
war materiel. In the late 1960s, however, prices fell when
the military market was glutted with copper and demand
declined. President Eduardo Frei (1911–82) of the
dominant Christian Democrat Party, who held office from
1964 to 1970, attempted unsuccessfully to resolve Chile’s
development problems, including breaking the
inflation–stagnation economic cycle resulting from a
too-heavy reliance on exports and on the narrow,
consumer-driven market. These constant problems,
501combined with discontent over low wages and massive
inequalities in income distribution, laid the groundwork for
the success and ultimate victory of a new approach
proposed by the Unidad Popular (UP, Popular Unity)
coalition. With the right and center divided, Salvador
Allende, a medical doctor and perennial Socialist Party
candidate, squeaked into office with 36 percent of the vote
and the narrow approval of Congress, which ultimately had
decided the outcome in favor of the UP.
The forces of conservatism (landed oligarchy,
multinational and domestic corporate executives, the
Catholic Church, rightists in the military and the media)
moved into action to stymie implementation of the UP
political program. Similarly, the election of a socialist, no
matter what his particular program might be, attracted the
attention of high-level US government officials, many of
whom had been actively working to prevent the rise to
power of a reformist ticket since the 1960s. After
Allende’s election they shifted from surveillance and
intelligence gathering to direct action, justified by Henry
Kissinger’s (b. 1923) cavalier dismissal of the Chilean
elections. The US Secretary of State and former National
Security Advisor to President Richard Nixon (1913–94)
reportedly remarked: “I don’t see why we should have to
stand by and let a country go communist due to the
irresponsibility of its own people.”1
The UP experience in the early 1970s was a microcosm of
the deep-seated dilemmas and divisions facing many Latin
American societies. Allende came to power through
elections, not through armed struggle along the lines of
Castro’s Cuba or Guevara’s foco strategy. As such he was
502tied to a program of redistributing wealth and mounting
social reforms within the confines of a constitutional
process, even in the face of intense opposition from an
entrenched elite and powerful military at home, and a
hostile set of policymakers and corporate managers
abroad. Peter Winn’s book Weavers of Revolution captures
the essence of that tug-of-war as it played out on the shop
floor of a single domestic textile plant owned by Juan and
Amador Yarur. According to Winn: “Yarur came to
symbolize both the demise of the old regime and the new
socialist order struggling to be born.”2
In a pattern that
mimicked the broader struggle in Chilean society, older,
unskilled, socially conservative workers lived in fear of
being fired, aware as they were that their minimal
education provided them few other options in society.
Begrudgingly or not, they had become resigned to their
exploitation and grateful for the occasional bonus or
Christmas roasting hen that the Yarur management doled
out to loyal workers. In the 1960s a younger, better
educated, and socialistinspired workforce launched a union
organizing drive, rejected the owners’ paternalism,
demanded decent wages, rational work rules, employee
benefits, and modern working conditions. Yarur thus
represented a microcosm of Chile, where a younger, more
militant segment of the population was mobilizing for
change, both at the ballot box and on the factory floor, and
coming up against a traditional society that feared it.
To create chaos in the Chilean economy and undermine
President Allende, and with the financial support of the
Anaconda and Kennecott copper giants, IT&T and other
major multinationals, factory owners in Chile cut back on
production. With ample funding from the fiercely
503anti-communist US labor federation, the AFL-CIO,
independent truckers refused to deliver goods to cities,
thereby sparking widespread shortages and inflation. At
the same time, throughout the country the UP’s program
was being put into practice by ordinary people who
supported Allende, sometimes without any officially
sanctioned right to do so. When owners abandoned
factories, workers took them over, expropriated the
property from under the old owners, and began to work the
machines on their own. Peasants occupied land long
denied them, and shantytown dwellers moved into vacant
lots and set up soup kitchens and rudimentary housing.
Caught between a rock and a hard place, the constitutional
government was powerless to stop the insurrection from
below, while fully aware that the more the poor demanded,
the more precarious was Allende’s chance of remaining in
power. Leadership for an aggressive confrontation with the
right came from university students and militant youths in
the radical left-wing Movimiento de la Izquierda
Revolucionário (MIR, Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), a group that supported the UP, but claimed that
Allende’s only security lay in arming the workers and
peasants and moving more rapidly with factory and land
occupations to stave off the imminent assault from the
right. As Allende was maneuvering for gradual change, the
MIR was calling for armed struggle in the spirit of Che
Guevara.
The Chilean Road to Socialism Dead Ends
On the morning of September 11, 1973 the military, under
the leadership of General Augusto Pinochet (1915–2006),
an army officer who had managed to neutralize or
504eliminate military officers loyal to Allende and the
Constitution, began the bombardment of the Moneda,
Chile’s presidential palace. A fleet of US navy warships
took up positions off the port at Valparaiso, in a move
reminiscent of the gunboat diplomacy the US had exerted
earlier in the century, and a group of US military advisors
gathered in the coastal town of Viña del Mar with the
Chilean military. Despite repeated denials from US
government officials, declassified documents have since
shown that Nixon and Kissinger, along with public and
private intelligence agencies, were apprised of, and even
enmeshed in, planning and executing the military takeover.
Allende died in the Moneda, most likely taking his own
life. His close associates were apprehended and killed, or
fled into exile. Military leader General Augusto Pinochet
moved swiftly to close Congress and ban all media outlets
supportive of Allende or opposed to the military takeover.
Universities were purged of opposition; the military ruled
through executive order; and Chile entered the dark days
of repression, torture, disappearance, and death for
thousands of activists who were unable or unwilling to
leave. For a while militants remained inside the country,
attempting to mount resistance to the junta, but many who
tried were rounded up and their organizations crushed and
dismantled. An estimated one million people left the
country.
The efficacy of the “Chilean Road to Socialism” would be
debated in years to come: Did the UP fail because the left
pushed too hard, thus precipitating the military coup? Did
sabotage from the right leave the UP with no other choice
but to mobilize in an attempt to save the social gains
Allende had initiated? Was it possible to transform a
505society through the ballot box, especially in countries of
Latin America with deep-rooted militaries and powerful
oligarchies? Was it the US, the CIA, and the multinational
corporations who overturned Allende’s government, or
were the contradictions between the agenda of the left and
the powerful interests on the right, between rich and poor,
and between competing definitions of revolutionary
strategy within Chilean society most responsible? Because
Chile’s economy eventually revived under military rule,
some economists contend that the dictatorship brought
prosperity to a disorganized economy, while others argue
that the massive sell-off of public resources that
characterized the Pinochet period actually undermined the
nation’s economy. Throughout the years of the dictatorship
income distribution was highly unequal and suffering and
persecution was widespread.
Questions about the Allende government persist on into
the twenty-first century, especially because Chile is now in
its second socialist administration since the return to
democracy in 1990. After years of legal wrangling,
including a dramatic house arrest in London and eventual
deportation back to Chile to face charges on human rights
abuses, kidnapping, and murder, General Pinochet died
before going to trial. Other officers have been charged and
convicted in what remains a long-running attempt to
redress the grievances caused by the lengthy and brutal
dictatorship.
Urban Guerrilla Warfare: Uruguay
Overshadowed by the more widely publicized military
takeovers in Chile, the events in Uruguay were possibly
506even more tragic in terms of the chain of events that led to
the destruction of a vital democracy. Nearly the smallest
country of Latin America, Uruguay for much of the
twentieth century was reputedly one of the most
prosperous. Similar to Argentina, early genocidal
campaigns against the indigenous people left the plains
and rolling hills vacant of inhabitants. Uruguay welcomed
immigrants, mostly from Italy, some from Spain and other
parts of Europe, who settled on the land and developed the
main economic enterprise: agriculture. In 1903 José Batlle
y Ordóñez (1856–1929) assumed the presidency after a
protracted civil war between conservative and liberal
factions. His efforts at unifying the country and
establishing a complex social welfare system are credited
with raising Uruguay’s standard of living on a par with
that of industrialized European nations. Its advanced social
system, the cosmopolitan capital and major port city of
Montevideo, and long-running, stable democracy earned it
the nickname “Switzerland of the Americas.” With an
economy heavily reliant on agricultural exports, especially
beef, mutton, hides, and tallow, as well as wheat and other
grains, Uruguay prospered during both world wars,
particularly World War II. When world food prices
dropped after war-ravaged Europe and Asia recovered,
Uruguayan exports plummeted, and the nation entered a
crisis for which it was quite unprepared. Social services
were cut, wages fell for the unionized workforce that had
been accustomed to fair compensation for their labor, and
social tension mounted. By the 1960s the period of
economic and political stability had begun to unravel, and
the government faced widespread opposition from the
students, workers, and low-income families who were
bearing the brunt of economic hardship.
507Like their counterparts in other Southern Cone countries,
Uruguayan students and radical young professionals
spearheaded an underground guerrilla movement that was
for many years one of the most daring and successful
organizations in Latin America, if not beyond. Named
after the Inca revolutionary Túpac Amaru II, who fought
against the Spanish colonial army in late
eighteenth-century Peru, the “Tupamaros” attracted
members of trade unions, peasants from some of the
poorest rural areas, and university students. Initially the
Tupamaros staged highly creative, and popular, “Robin
Hood-type” guerrilla actions, such as robbing banks and
invading food warehouses and distributing the cash and
food to the poor. They became well known for publishing
exposés of graft and corruption among businessmen and
politicians, much to the embarrassment of Uruguay’s elite.
The Tupamaros had both an underground revolutionary
organization and an above-ground counterpart organized
into the Frente Amplio (Broad Front), which was effective
in winning support for the clandestine movement among
some sectors of the population, but not enough to win
electoral office, as the Unidad Popular was able to do at
roughly the same time in Chile.
By the late 1960s their tactics escalated to political
kidnappings and assassination. Their most spectacular feat
was the kidnapping and subsequent assassination of Dan
Mitrione, a US Agency for International Development
(AID) public safety officer who was known for his role in
training police throughout Latin America in surveillance
and torture methods. From 1969 through 1971 the
Tupamaros successfully kidnapped and held for ransom a
powerful bank manager, Pereyra Rebervel, and Geoffrey
508Jackson, England’s ambassador to Uruguay (in one case in
exchange for the release of political prisoners and in the
other as a guarantee that national elections would proceed
on schedule). As the economic crisis deepened, the
military and police escalated their war against the
insurgents. Soon the civilian government collapsed and the
army seized power in 1973, ushering in 11 years of
military rule that were among the most repressive in all of
Latin America. Montevideo, once a stunning port city of
European-style architecture similar to Buenos Aires, fell
into disrepair; a huge number of Uruguayans emigrated to
Australia, Europe, and other countries of Latin America;
and much of Uruguay’s prosperous middle-class life
ceased to exist.
In 1984, after over a decade of stultifying repression, the
dictatorship ended. In the same wave that restored
democratic governments in Argentina and Brazil, the
military stepped down in Uruguay, and Julio María
Sanguinetti became president of a country that the military
had all but destroyed. In a general amnesty, Tupamaros
held in prison for over a decade were released; they
regrouped under the Frente Amplio and began winning
elections. The current president, Tabaré Vásquez (b. 1940),
a medical doctor who trained in France, traces his roots to
the Tupamaros. After serving as mayor of Montevideo in
the early 1990s, he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency
on the Frente Amplio ticket in 1994 and 1999, but was
elected in 2004.
Urban Guerrilla Warfare: Argentina
509Whereas Uruguay’s path to armed conflict represented a
dramatic shift away from years of European-style social
democracy, Argentina’s descent into a chaotic war
between the military and police on the one hand, and urban
guerrilla organizations on the other, constituted yet another
chapter in that nation’s twentieth-century struggle between
left and right. For the most part, the right held power
through a string of military governments. In the 1940s and
1950s the Peronist government, despite its corruption and
uneven record of defending the masses, had managed to
wring from the traditional oligarchy and industrialists
concessions that improved the lives of many working
people. From 1970 to 1976 Argentine politics began
another tug-of-war and, although there were many players,
this round of the struggle pitted the government, supported
by military and paramilitary forces, against powerful
underground urban guerrilla combatants. What led to this
shift?
After he was deposed in 1955, Juan Perón had spent his
time in exile as the guest of a series of right-wing
governments: Paraguay, Venezuela, the Dominican
Republic, and Panama, where he met his third wife,
nightclub dancer María Estela (Isabel) Martínez. He
eventually settled in Spain. In Argentina, despite years of
military rule interspersed with civilian governments
supported by the urban middle class, Peronism, with its
contradictory strains of social welfare, personalist
demagoguery, and corruption, lingered just below the
surface of Argentine political life, permeating civil society
institutions, especially the trade union federation. For its
part, the military was presiding over a nation in economic
chaos, resulting from the accumulation of an enormous
510foreign debt that in turn fed inflation, as the government
borrowed more and more money from abroad to make
payments and stabilize Argentine society. By the late
1960s the central government was unable, or unwilling, to
wring concessions from the oligarchy in order to increase
wages, offset rising hunger, or hold onto a modicum of
support from middle-class consumers unable to buy
essentials, much less luxuries. The government attempted
to install wage and price controls by printing money in
hopes of staving off the crisis, but this simply contributed
to spiraling inflation.
Confronting constant demonstrations and increasing
attacks from guerrilla movements, especially the People’s
Revolutionary Army (ERP) and the leftist,
Peronist-inspired Montoneros, the government decided to
allow the Peronists to field a candidate in the 1973
presidential elections. Winning with a bare 49 percent of
the vote, Peronist candidate Héctor Cámpora (1909–80)
assumed office in a caretaker capacity, awaiting Perón’s
return from exile later that year. On June 30, 1973 a crowd
estimated at 3.5 million people came to Buenos Aires’
Ezeiza Airport to welcome the 77-year-old Perón home
from exile in Spain. This huge congregation included
members of militant left- and right-wing Peronist groups,
powerful trade unions, organized political parties, and a
huge number of unaffiliated citizens who hoped that
Perón’s return would bring an end to the internal conflict.
Instead, marksmen from the terrorist Alianza
Anticomunista Argentina (Argentine Anticommunist
Alliance), better known as the “Triple A,” opened fire on
the crowd, killing at least 13 and injuring hundreds. The
Triple A was a far-right group under the leadership of José
511López Rega (1916–89), Perón’s personal secretary who
had accompanied him into exile. This event, known as the
Ezeiza Massacre, marked the opening round in a battle
between left and right factions of the Peronist movement
that terrorized Argentina until the 1976 military coup.
With Perón back in the country, Cámpora stepped down,
thereby signaling the end of the left’s hold on the
presidency, and paving the way for Perón to run for
president with his third wife as vice-president. He won
easily, garnering 62 percent of the vote.
During 1973–4 Perón failed (or refused) to unite and
pacify the wings of the Peronist movement, opting instead
to allow the military to hunt down and jail any supposed
opponents of the regime. He had signaled in an August
1973 speech to the governors of the country his disavowal
of support for the Montoneros, for the tactics of
discontented youth, and for the strategy of guerrilla
warfare. Perón’s 1973 speech was the signal that drove the
entire guerrilla opposition permanently underground, and
members of above-ground mass organizations ceased to
operate openly. After a corrupt, ineffectual, and repressive
couple of years in office, Perón died and his 43-year-old
wife Isabel became head of the fourth civilian government
in 14 months. With no governmental experience, and less
political sense, Isabelita Perón was a disaster, her
presidency nothing short of a catastrophe. From 1974 until
the military stepped back into formal power in March
1976, the government was actually in the hands of José
López Rega, who served as the president’s confidante,
astrologer, and henchman. From his position as Minister of
Social Welfare, López Rega directed the “Triple A”
paramilitary death squads, who worked in tandem with the
512army, navy, and air force to terrorize the population into
submission (see Box 12.1).
In response, guerrilla movements stepped up their
opposition. The Montoneros, the largest of the groups, had
achieved a high level of notoriety as a result of their daring
bank robberies and kidnappings, and were known to have
accumulated a very substantial cache of money from
multinational corporations who paid protection money to
ensure the safety of their executives. Formed in 1964, the
Montoneros were a clandestine army with broad influence
in the above-ground opposition movement, including trade
unionists, university students, and community activists.
Although they claimed the mantle of Perón, especially the
social welfare programs run by Eva Perón in the 1940s and
1950s, the Montoneros stood apart from conservative trade
union leaders, whom they criticized for refusing to oppose
the fascist tendencies of López Rega and other right-wing
Peronists.
Box 12.1 The US and Operation Condor
Declassified government documents show that the
US was supportive of a plan called “Operation
Condor,” a secret alliance linking the military
dictatorships of Chile, Argentina, Paraguay,
Uruguay, and Brazil that coordinated the arrest,
detention, disappearance, and torture of dissidents
in these countries during the 1970s and 1980s.
Under the military dictatorship of Alfredo
513Stroessner, Paraguay served as the center for this
coordination and the conduit between the military
regimes and the United States. In a cable from US
Ambassador Robert White (Paraguay) to Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance, sent October 20, 1978, the
ambassador states in part:
On October 11 I called again on Chief of Staff
(Paraguay) Alejandro Fretes Davalos. He read me
the Acta or Summary Minutes resulting from the
visit of General Orozco, Chief of Intelligence to
Asunción . . .
The document is basically an agreement to
coordinate all intelligence resources in order to
control and eliminate subversion. It speaks of
exchange of information, prompt use of
communication facilities, monitoring of
subversives, and their detention and informal
handover from one country to the other. It repeats
over and over the need for full cooperation and
mutually facilitative acts in the context of a fight to
the death against subversion . . .
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and
Uruguay make of [sic] the net, although Uruguay is
now almost on the inactive list . . . They keep in
touch with one another through U.S.
communications installations in the Panama Canal
Zone which covers all of Latin America.

Dictatorship and State Terror
On March 24, 1976, the military, under the leadership of
General Jorge Rafael Videla (b. 1925), overthrew Isabel
Perón’s government and launched a campaign they called
the “War Against Subversion.”3
For seven years, from
1976 to 1983, the army embarked on a program no
previous government, civilian or military, had attempted:
to wipe out all vestiges of Peronism (ignoring ideological
distinctions) and its organizations, along with the last
remnants of democratic, civil society. Once the military
dictators outlawed all representative bodies, silenced the
legal opposition, and began arresting anyone they deemed
suspicious, the guerrilla forces headed by the ERP and
Montoneros were all that was left to continue the struggle,
until their defeat around 1978.

(Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada), Buenos Aires. The
largest of the many torture centers spread throughout the
city during the dictatorship, the ESMA continued as a
school for training cadets while areas of the building
served as torture cells, storage lockers for property stolen
from prisoners, and a small “hospital” where young
women gave birth before their babies were taken from
them and given to friends of the military leaders. All but a
handful of people taken to the ESMA “disappeared.”

515The repression of the 1970s and 1980s claimed the lives of
more than 30,000 civilians, the vast majority of them never
accounted for and simply “disappeared” from society
without leaving behind any record of arrest, detention, or
charges (Figure 12.1). On December 27, 1978, at the
height of the war, the US Embassy officer in charge of
human rights, F. Allen “Tex” Harris, wrote in his briefing
memo to the US State Department that the “armed services
had been forced to ‘take care of’ 15,000 persons in its
anti-subversion campaign.” Today that number is known
to have been much higher, since the Federal Court of
Argentina earlier that same year had compiled a secret
document (made public after the dictatorship left power)
reporting that 22,000 of the disappeared had been killed.4
Years after the return to civilian government in 1983, a
few conscience-stricken former military officers, such as
navy captain Adolfo Scilingo, testified before the National
516Commission on Disappeared People. Scilingo described
how prisoners were drugged, loaded onto military planes,
and thrown out, naked and semi-conscious, into the
Atlantic Ocean. Residents of towns along the Rio de la
Plata have for years discovered human remains washed up
on the shore; more recently mass graves have been
exhumed in remote areas of the coastline, where either
compliant or fearful citizens, along with military
regiments, attempted to bury the evidence of the massive
number of executions.
Who were the victims of state terror? The sweep of the
military was broad and often indiscriminate. In factories
and workplaces unionists were sorted out and disappeared.
At the Ford Motor plant 25 union delegates were detained
and disappeared inside the plant’s very own clandestine
detention center for days, weeks, or months until they were
secretly transferred to the local police precinct transformed
into a military center. According to Pedro Troiani, a union
delegate for six years in the Ford plant in Pacheco until the
1976 coup, “The company used the disappearances to get
rid of unionism at the factory.” Similarly, an estimated 20
workers disappeared from the Mercedes-Benz plant, which
had also been transformed into a clandestine torture and
detention center. At least 46 workers from the offices of
the Buenos Aires Provincial Bank were singled out for
union organizing activity, apprehended, and never seen
again.
According to the Commission’s report, Nunca Más,
published in 1984 (translated into English as Never Again,
1986), most of those arrested and disappeared were
university and high school students, young professionals
517and workers. Some had been active in political
organizations, but many others were simply taken because
their name was in the address book of a detainee. The
overwhelming majority of those arrested and disappeared
were under the age of 35, as, oddly enough, were the men
and women who arrested, tortured, humiliated, and
executed them. A disproportionate number were Jews; the
military’s anti-Semitism was documented in Prisoner
Without a Name, Cell Without a Number, newspaper editor
Jacobo Timmerman’s graphic testimony of his arrest and
torture, published after an international outcry secured his
release. In addition to the more than 30,000 disappeared
and presumed dead, over 800,000 people left the country.
Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo
During the darkest period, from 1976 to 1982, the lone
voices of public opposition belonged to a few mothers who
began to gather in the plaza in front of the presidential
palace, called the Casa Rosada (the Rose, or Pink, House).
They began marching at first on Sundays and later every
Thursday, demanding to know the fate of their disappeared
children. Wearing white scarves as a symbol of their
children’s diapers, and carrying photographs of their
young adult sons and daughters, the Mothers of the Plaza
de Mayo began to draw international attention to the brutal
repression the military had unleashed (Figure 12.2). They
exposed the blind eye of most world governments in
relation to human rights abuses in Argentina, and
denounced the warm relationship between the US
government and the generals. Recently declassified cables
sent from Washington to Buenos Aires reveal that
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in the days after the
518March coup, had ordered his subordinates to “encourage”
the new regime by providing financial support (see Box
12.2). A month after the coup and amidst reports of
widespread human rights abuses in Argentina, Washington
approved $50 million in military aid to the junta. At the
urging of the US, on March 27, 1976, three days after the
coup, the IMF extended the military government $127
million in credit.

their children and grandchildren who disappeared during
the military regime. (Nancy Borowick photo)
519The War of the Malvinas/Falkland Islands
Despite repression and forced austerity that reduced wages
by 40 percent in a little over a year, the regime was unable
to resolve the economic crisis. A record number of
bankruptcies occurred in 1982; inflation soared from a
destabilizing 300 percent in 1975–6 to 500 percent the
same year, and the international debt continued to
skyrocket. The economic crisis added to general disquiet at
home, and mounting criticism from abroad over human
rights abuses and highly publicized cases of
disappearances. News that the children of pregnant
detainees were being sold for international adoption or
turned over to military families after their mothers were
killed was especially damaging to the military regime.

Meeting Transcripts: Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, Chairman, DECLASSIFIED SECRET
Two days after the military coup, Secretary of State
Kissinger convened his weekly staff meeting. In
this declassified secret transcript of the first
conversation on Argentina, Assistant Secretary for
Latin America, William Rogers, informs Kissinger
that for the Argentine generals’ government to
succeed, they will make “a considerable effort to
involve the United States – particularly in the
financial field.” Kissinger responds, “Yes, but that
is in our interest.”
520Rogers advises that “we ought not at this moment
rush out and embrace this new regime” because he
expects significant repression to follow the coup. “I
think also we’ve got to expect a fair amount of
repression, probably a good deal of blood, in
Argentina before too long. I think they’re going to
have to come down very hard not only on the
terrorists but on the dissidents of trade unions and
their parties.” In response, Kissinger makes his
preferences clear: “Whatever chance they have,
they will need a little encouragement . . . because I
do want to encourage them. I don’t want to give the
sense that they’re harassed by the United States.”
Other documents reveal that in September 1976
several Argentine military officers traveled to
Washington where they met with Secretary
Kissinger and other US officials. They returned to
Argentina “euphoric” over the approval their
tactics had received from the US, especially from
Kissinger, who reported that he realized there
would be “a lot of blood.”

In an attempt to win popular support, the military launched
in April 1982 a drive to take back the Malvinas, or
Falkland, Islands from the British, who had taken them
from the Spanish in 1833. Argentina’s claim that the
islands should have reverted to them along with the rest of
521the territory when the country achieved independence from
Spain had languished in international courts for years.
General Leopoldo Galtieri (1926–2003), the military
officer who launched the attack on the sparsely inhabited
islands over 500 miles off the coast of Argentina, never
thought Great Britain would defend their possession; in the
language of modern invasions, he though it would be a
“cake walk.” Britain did, however, send a small, but
extremely well equipped force, including nuclear-powered
submarines, and dislodged the Argentine invaders in a
matter of weeks. In addition the Argentines miscalculated
badly when they assumed the US would side with them
against the English, although such an assumption was not
without basis. President Reagan (1911–2004) had warmly
received General Galtieri at the White House when he
visited Washington in 1981; the Argentine army was
clandestinely training an army of “Contras” to dislodge the
victorious Sandinistas from the government of Nicaragua;
and the US ambassador to the United Nations, Jean
Kirkpatrick, argued publicly, and unsuccessfully, in favor
of allying with the Argentines against England. The fiasco
of the Malvinas spelled the death knell of the military
regime. The nationalist fervor that gripped the nation in
April 1982, when the Argentine army strutted its seizure of
the islands from its former neocolonial power, had
evaporated by June, when the starving army returned to
Buenos Aires in humiliating defeat. General Galtieri
resigned as head of the junta and his successor promised
elections.
In 1983 the Radical Party candidate Raúl Alfonsín Foulkes
(1927–2009) won the presidency and began the process of
rebuilding the devastated economy and political structures.
522Alfonsín successfully prosecuted and imprisoned many of
the previous military rulers and their collaborators, but was
not able to turn around the economy or stem
hyperinflation. In 1989 conservative Peronist candidate
Carlos Saúl Menem (b. 1930) was elected president. He
promptly pardoned many top military officers convicted of
human rights violations and adopted a subservient stance
toward the neoliberal policies of the IMF and World Bank
in hopes of rehabilitating the economy, including a
disastrous scheme of pegging the value of the peso directly
to the dollar. Not only was Menem personally dishonest,
but graft and corruption permeated every branch of his
administration. His governments and those that
immediately followed oversaw the further demise of
Argentina’s once rich and stable democracy, until such
point that the nation was teetering on the edge of
bankruptcy by December 2002.
The movements in pursuit of a socialist alternative in the
Southern Cone drew together members of an ethnically
homogenous population whose divisions existed along
lines of class, urban vs. rural, region and gender. In the
Andean countries, on the other hand, popular uprisings
have often foundered on ethnic and racial divisions that
have persisted from as far back as the colonial era. There
have been, however, times when leaders from both sides of
the cultural divide have attempted to find common ground
to change society.
Movements for Revolutionary Change: Peru
Peru’s history with guerrilla struggle dates back to the
1960s, with the emergence of Cuban-inspired Marxist
523groups similar to those that appeared in other parts of Latin
America. Years of intermittent military government, along
with the failed experiment of Haya de la Torre’s left
populism, led progressive reformers to believe that the
only way to achieve even a modicum of equality was by
embracing a revolutionary Marxist program. In the years
after Haya’s demise, Trotskyist agronomist Hugo Blanco
(b. 1934) attempted to organize a land reform movement in
the country around the highland city of Cuzco. Although
the program never got off the ground, Hugo Blanco
succeeded in leading strikes and land seizures that put the
issue of agrarian reform before the government in the
1960s. Failure to win reform through legitimate channels
produced the same outcome in Peru as it had in
neighboring countries: an insurgent guerrilla movement,
uniting intellectuals and some on the left who had been
involved in the ongoing struggle for social change. As in
Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile, recruits to the new
guerrilla movement had grown discontented with the
go-slow approach of existing leftist organizations,
especially the Peruvian Communist Party.
The most prominent of the 1960s groups was the Army of
National Liberation (ELN, Ejercito de Liberación
Nacional), which attempted to organize the rural peasantry
into strategic hamlets capable of attacking the seat of
government. By 1970 the ELN had all but disbanded, most
of its leadership was in jail, and the remaining militants
were unable to convince the moribund Communist Party of
the need to adopt a more activist program. While many
activists looked to the Cuban model, in hopes of bringing
the same transformation to their own country, a small
fraction of the Peruvian left was looking further east, to
524China and its Cultural Revolution (1966–76), as a model
for revolutionary change, eventually spawning the most
doctrinaire Maoist organizations in the hemisphere.
Sendero Luminoso, The Shining Path
Under the leadership of Abimael Guzmán Reynoso (b.
1934), a philosophy professor at the University of San
Cristóbal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, a city in
the central Andean region, a faction of the Communist
Party of Peru formed itself into a highly disciplined
guerrilla organization that came to be known as Sendero
Luminoso, or Shining Path. The name derived from a quote
from the founder of Peru’s Communist Party José Carlos
Mariátegui (“Marxism-Leninism will open the shining
path to revolution”) that appeared on the masthead of the
group’s newspaper in 1964. The name “Shining Path” was
used by outsiders to distinguish the organization from
other (pro-Moscow, or pro-Cuba/Guevarist) Peruvian
communist parties. In the late 1960s Shining Path emerged
as a powerful political force among intellectuals, running
for electoral positions at Huamanga, in particular, as well
as other universities, and distinguishing itself by its serious
application of Marxist ideas to the local university
struggle. Eventually the party’s rigid sectarianism caused it
to fall out of favor among intellectuals, and it left the
university milieu to organize among impoverished
peasants.
In a society with high poverty rates and disastrously low
educational levels, abysmal health care and very weak
infrastructure to connect urban and rural areas, Peru’s
indigenous people were by far the most deprived, isolated,
525and forgotten members of society. These descendants of
the ancient Aymara, Quechua, and other indigenous groups
scattered along the Amazon River basin in the far northeast
were concentrated in remote villages far from the
institutions of European custom and culture. Indicative of
the scale of the indigenous presence in the population is
the fact that Quechua is one of Peru’s two official
languages, along with Spanish, and there are many areas of
the country where Spanish is seldom spoken. Illiterate and
non-conversant in Spanish, Indians who left the
countryside in search of work in urban areas found few
opportunities and ended up crowded in shantytowns on the
outskirts of Lima, Cuzco, Arequipa, Callao, and other
cities. It was, however, in the countryside, not urban areas,
that Shining Path developed its strongest following.
Shining Path launched its first military operation in May
1980, on the eve of Peru’s first national elections in 17
years. The timing of this event illustrates the group’s
unique politics and differentiates its strategy from those of
other guerrilla forces in the hemisphere. Rather than
resorting to clandestine actions after legitimate
above-ground movement had been suppressed, as was the
case in Argentina and Uruguay, Shining Path sought to use
the clandestine arena to destroy, or in their words to
“expose,” the hypocrisy of bourgeois elections. The
opening salvo in May 1980 was followed by more than a
decade of guerrilla warfare that targeted the police,
military, and government officials, as well as large
numbers of social reformers, political activists, and
managers of statecontrolled agricultural collectives.
Arguing that even trade unionists, community activists,
and human rights workers were supporters of the status
526quo, Shining Path cadres sought to destroy all vestiges of
Peru’s European heritage and to replace it with a “pure”
rural, communal indigenous society. Throughout the 1980s
Shining Path expanded the territory under its control and
increased the number of militants in its organization,
particularly in the highlands and around Ayacucho. It
gained some support from peasants, by publically beating
and killing widely disliked figures such as cattle rustlers,
tax collectors, and wealthy local merchants. While
peasants may have supported the guerrillas’ goals, only a
small minority ever adopted the strict Maoist dogma
emanating from the tiny cadre of leaders clustered around
Abimael Guzmán.
At first the national government viewed Shining Path as an
aberration, unable to believe that a university professor
preaching a Maoist doctrine among non-Spanishspeaking
indigenous peasants in remote rural areas would achieve
much success. Once the government registered the threat,
it launched a brutal and unforgiving attack on the villagers,
without bothering to separate Shining Path followers from
those who remained neutral or even opposed the guerrillas’
tactics. As the military swept through Ayacucho and other
regions where Shining Path was known to have
sympathizers, arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and raping
whomever they encountered, the effect on the peasantry
was nothing short of disastrous. Whole villages were
wiped out, and many rural dwellers found themselves
victims of both senderista attacks and military reprisals.
By the mid-1980s Shining Path had moved from the
countryside to the cities, stepping up assaults on key
infrastructure, industries, and residential neighborhoods in
527Lima. Beginning in 1983 and continuing over the next
decade, the senderistas increasingly controlled wide
swaths of territory on the outskirts of Lima, stretching into
the central and southern regions of the country. From bases
in the countryside they attacked urban areas, cut power to
whole quarters of Lima, bombed APRA party
headquarters, detonated explosives in shopping centers,
and set off a huge car bomb in the wealthy neighborhood
of Miraflores, which killed over 20 people and injured
many more. In addition to targeting government
institutions and the wealthy, Shining Path also sought to
eliminate those it considered to be competitors for the
loyalty of the masses – particularly other leftists,
progressives, and human rights activists. It came into
conflict with the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement
(MRTA), another armed guerrilla organization, and some
smaller leftist parties and peasant self-defense groups. In
1991 a Shining Path cadre killed three foreign missionaries
(one Italian and two Polish) who were working among the
poor in Ancash. In an especially gruesome finale, the
guerrillas then exploded the priests’ bodies in the center of
town. In February 1992, they assassinated María Elena
Moyano, a much admired community activist in one of
Lima’s largest shantytowns. Simultaneously, Shining Path
was abandoning whatever socialist, reformist doctrine it
had originally espoused and turning into a cultish terrorist
organization, grouped around its bizarre and increasingly
self-absorbed leader, Abimael Guzmán (called “Comrade
Gonzalo”).
Women and Shining Path
528One of the unique features of the Shining Path guerrilla
organization was the high percentage of women cadres.
Journalist Robin Kirk conducted an extensive study of the
“senderistas” and reported that according to Peruvian
police intelligence records, of the 19-member Central
Committee, eight were women. Compared to other
political organizations, clandestine or above-ground, this
was a remarkably high number. Women were frequently
commanders of army units, carried out attacks on villages,
were known to lob dynamite sticks hidden in their shawls
at police stations or other targets, and were often
designated to carry out the final, execution-style,
assassination of Shining Path’s captives. According to
Kirk, not only was the first guerrilla to fall in battle a
woman, but women were in leadership in the military and
communication wings of the party. Peruvians, the majority
of whom were appalled by the senderistas’ brutal tactics,
were even more at a loss to explain the particularly violent
actions of, mainly, indigenous women.
Women may have been drawn to the Shining Path because
it provided a sense of purpose and promised to create a
better life for them and their children. Moreover, when
senderistas took control of an area they immediately
prohibited drinking, imposed a strict code of discipline for
sexual relations between men and women, closed brothels,
and outlawed infidelity, gambling, and other vices that
were seen to interfere with party discipline and pose
security risks. The appeal of a group was considerable
when it banned the main scourges indigenous women
endured from their husbands and boyfriends alcoholism,
infidelity, and abuse. Possibly women who had faced a
lifetime of violence may have welcomed the chance to
529learn to fight, shoot a gun, and otherwise defend
themselves. The party also actively recruited women to its
ranks, and, like most revolutionary organizations, argued
that women’s liberation would come about as a result of
their active participation in the struggle. On the other hand,
while Abimael Guzmán promoted women’s emancipation
and wrote frequently of its importance in party dogma, he
maintained paternalistic, even patriarchal, control over the
women with whom he had contact, to the extent that they
were expected to worship “Comrade Gonzalo” and satisfy
his sexual demands. In spite of this, the large number of
women and girls involved in Shining Path was
unprecedented for Latin American guerrilla movements at
the time. While many women were involved in the Central
American revolutions of the 1980s, even in Nicaragua and
El Salvador the number of women leaders never matched
those in Shining Path.
Owing to its widely publicized abuse of the population and
increasingly brutal military tactics, Shining Path became
known far more for its atrocities than its ability to redress
the grievances the poor. Caught between two powerful
forces – the military and the guerrillas – most Peruvians
were hard pressed to decide which was worse. The
organization’s reprehensible tactics were met with
reprisals from local townspeople; men and women
organized into anti-Shining Path militias, sometimes
retaliating with the same brutal tactics as the guerrillas.
Based on a tip from neighbors, the police began
monitoring an apartment in Lima, which eventually led to
the capture of the Shining Path leadership, including
Guzmán himself. By the late 1990s Shining Path militants
were in jail, on trial, or had retreated from their activist
530program and splintered into competing factions, rendering
the organization impotent. While the possibility of a
resurgence of Shining Path activity cannot be discounted,
Peru’s attention shifted to the extra-legal activities of its
military and government.
Repression and Fujimori
Controversy still swirls around Alberto Fujimori (b. 1938),
the man who headed Peru during most of the turbulent era
when guerrilla activity was at its height. The debate over
Fujimori’s leadership revolves around whether the
government’s tactics were as bad as, or worse than, the
tactics of the Shining Path. As far back as the early 1990s,
Fujimori promised economic reforms but delivered mainly
austerity and indiscriminate repression as a way of
quelling the violence that gripped society. A member of
Peru’s small Asian community, comprised of Chinese and
Japanese immigrants, Fujimori was a middle-class
entrepreneur who rose in politics through business
connections rather than through the military or political
parties – the traditional road to national political
prominence. As the first Japanese-American to win the
highest office in any nation of the Americas, North or
South, Fujimori initially was trusted (possibly due to
stereotypes of Japanese businessmen as efficient
managers) to be the kind of leader who would work
diligently to attract foreign investment, create jobs, and
otherwise stimulate the economy. This did not prove to be
the case. Although elected to three terms, he was ousted
from office in November 2000 in the face of widespread
corruption charges that extended to his top ministers as
well. Offered asylum in Japan, where his family had
531maintained citizenship rights after emigrating to Peru,
Fujimori moved to Tokyo. Despite his continued
popularity among many sectors of the population who
approved of the draconian measures he enacted to curb the
violence, his bid to return to political prominence
collapsed when he was detained in Chile and subsequently
extradited to Peru for trial. After several delays, the
Peruvian Supreme Court in early 2008 found the former
president guilty as charged and sentenced him to prison.
Despite the failure of his appeals, Fujimori’s fate remains
in question because of his continuing popularity among
nearly a third of the electorate, and the unpopularity of his
successors. Alejandro Toledo (b. 1946) held office from
2001 to 2006, but failed to turn around the economy and to
put a stop to endemic corruption. Many Peruvians were
particularly disappointed with Toledo’s downfall because
his rags-to-riches personal story held out hope for a new
beginning. Born into an impoverished family with 15
brothers and sisters, Toledo rose to earn a PhD in
economics from Stanford University before becoming
president. After a hotly contested race in 2006, Alan
García (b. 1949), a former APRA president, won office
with promises of a new beginning and return to stable
governance, despite charges of ineptitude and corruption
during his earlier administration.
Conclusion
The focus of this chapter has been primarily political. The
struggle to improve education and health care, to provide a
social safety net for the chronically unemployed, the
disabled, ill, and needy members of society, was taken up
532in the political arena. Members of different Latin
American countries proffered solutions, with greater and
lesser degrees of sincerity and practicality, but none
succeeded. In the 1980s most of the region was under the
boot of repressive military dictatorships or authoritarian
regimes. The forces in control of the government answered
moderate and radical demands with the same repressive
measures, despite the resilient opposition of many sectors
of Latin American society. From Mexico to Argentina, the
era of student protest, urban guerrilla warfare, and
socialism-through-the-ballot-box had burst forth only to be
brutally stifled.
By the late twentieth century nationalism had proven the
most enduring of the many ideological currents rocking
Latin America. But this was the case not because of its
cultural and political cohesion among disparate Latin
American nations; rather because nationalism reflected
widespread wariness, hostility, and suspicion of the United
States. Even right-wing governments whose very
subsistence depended on foreign aid found it convenient to
play the nationalist card when their popularity sagged. The
Argentine misadventure at the Falkland/Malvinas Islands
in 1982 was a case in point, and a lesson on how easily
such schemes could backfire.
For its part, from the end of World War II until the fall of
Eastern European communism in 1990, the US justified its
interference in Latin American internal affairs as necessary
for stopping the spread of communism. Washington
readily labeled modest attempts at self-determination, such
as Guatemala in 1954, Brazil in 1964, or Chile in 1973, as
communist takeovers that threatened the national security
533interests of the hemisphere. From the Monroe Doctrine of
the early nineteenth century to the Roosevelt Corollary a
century later, the US defined Latin America’s interests as
essentially one with US corporations. Falling under the
weight of internal opposition as much as external
interference, mild reform, violent revolution, and social
democracy failed in Mexico, in huge Brazil, in
cosmopolitan Argentina and Uruguay, and in neighboring
Chile. Peru fell into a brutal and distorted revolutionary
conflict with little clear difference between the side
seeking social change and the one enforcing the status quo.
Nevertheless, in a few tiny countries of Central America
rural and urban youth once again embraced the Guevarist
strategy in a new attempt to wrest power from the
traditional oligarchy. The next chapter looks at the success
and failure of those insurgencies.
53413
Revolution and Its Alternatives
Late twentieth-century Latin Americans debated who
constituted the nation and who were the rightful owners of
the continent’s national identity. Were the people of this
vast continent moving toward a compatible mixture of race
and ethnicity, or remaining mired in irreconcilable
differences between Europeans, Indians, Africans, and
their mixed descendants? More importantly, how could the
social inequality stemming from regional, class, and ethnic
difference disappear? The left embraced Marxist socialism,
some form of revolutionary anti-imperialism, or state
intervention to alleviate inequality, while the right argued
for neoliberalism, free markets, and privatization,
sometimes to enrich the entrenched elite, but in many
cases as the only way to clean up corrupt bureaucracies.
A battle over religion was also raging. This current pitted
liberation theology and Christian community activism on
the left against fundamentalist Protestant evangelicalism
on the right. These ideological impulses – Marxism versus
neoliberalism, liberation theology versus evangelical
Protestantism – were not, however, clearly demarcated.
Not all evangelicals sided with the political right, and
although liberation theologians leaned left, not all
embraced Marxism. Even interpretations of Marxism
varied; some of the left-wing guerrilla organizations were
more dogmatic in their acceptance of socialist and
communist ideology than others.
535Previous chapters have demonstrated that as long as the
United States was locked in conflict with the Soviet Union,
and Cuba remained a Soviet ally just 90 miles away, US
governments of both liberal and conservative persuasion
were willing to overlook human rights violations in return
for strict loyalty to the US agenda. The best guarantee of
such allegiance had always been military dictatorships
maintained by generous military aid, training, and arms
supplies from the United States. From the 1960s through
the early 1990s Central America (with the notable
exception of Costa Rica) became the battleground for this
fierce ideological war, the result of which was to push
already impoverished peoples – primarily in Nicaragua, El
Salvador, and Guatemala toward even greater misery and
devastation. Particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador,
leading activists in the Catholic Church spoke out against
these trends, inserting a new activist religiosity into
politics.
A Changing Catholic Church
The Central American wars formed the backdrop for a
profound shift in priorities in Latin America’s Catholic
Church. Beginning in the 1960s and peaking during the
1980s, a large number of working clergy turned away from
the Church’s traditional alignments with the powerful
elites, ignored threats from the Vatican (and often their
own hierarchy) to avoid radical movements, and instead
took up the struggle for equality and rights for the poor.
Catholic activism in support of social change profoundly
influenced guerrilla movements in Nicaragua, El Salvador,
and Guatemala, introducing a moral and spiritual
justification that had not been part of previous guerrilla
536uprisings, especially in Cuba. Throughout Latin America
and the Caribbean, a wing of the Church surfaced as a
powerful ideological force in the struggle to end
authoritarian regimes.
This new theology, referred to as the “Theology of
Liberation,” had its strongest expression in Brazil,
Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Throughout history individual
priests and nuns have chosen to minister to the poor and
call attention to injustice. Outstanding examples include
Father Bartolomé de las Casas’s condemnation of Indian
slavery in the sixteenth century and the insurrections led
by Fathers Hidalgo and Morelos in nineteenth-century
Mexico in defense of indigenous people, among others.
But for the most part, the Catholic Church hierarchy had
not sided with the poor. Indeed, on a number of occasions
the Church had strongly opposed social reforms instituted
by secular authorities – from caudillos of the nineteenth
century to authoritarian presidents and military dictators of
the twentieth. The Catholic Church played almost no role
in opposing the slavery of Africans, a practice that endured
for several centuries in Brazil and other parts of Latin
America. In impoverished Indian and mestizo parishes
priests charged for services such as weddings, baptisms,
and funerals no matter the financial burden placed on
grieving families. The Church historically opposed rights
for women, intervening repeatedly to prevent women from
obtaining reproductive rights as well as the rights to
divorce, vote, and have freedom from abusive fathers and
husbands. Instead, the Catholic Church concentrated its
efforts on the administration of orphanages, hospitals,
schools, and an extensive network of charities that serviced
the needy. At the same time, the Church’s wealth was
537apparent everywhere. Grandiose and elaborately decorated
cathedrals, often built by conscripted Indian and slave
labor, towered over the center of even the smallest town.
Priests and bishops lived well, dined with the aristocracy,
and routinely considered themselves a part of the elite of
the towns and cities of the empire, and later of the region’s
independent republics.
Transformation in the Latin American Church stemmed
from the liberal climate encouraged by the Second Vatican
Council, convened in 1962 under Pope John XXIII
(1881–1963). Beginning as a reform movement at the
center of the Church in Rome, and instigated in no small
part because the Church was in desperate need of
modernizing both its theory and its practice to hold onto its
following, Vatican II swept away many feudal customs
and outdated ideas. It transformed the distant and
impersonal Latin Mass, eliminated the more mystical
saints, and generally attempted to pull Church doctrine
more into line with modern social conditions and
problems. Because Pope John XXIII led the modernizing
process, calling the first ecumenical council in over 400
years, and guiding the Church in a new direction that
included the needs of the poor and oppressed, Vatican II
carried enormous weight.
Although Vatican II did not embrace the socialist
principles that came to be associated with liberation
theology – and John XXIII excommunicated Fidel Castro
for his embrace of Marxism – it did call into question the
Church’s traditional alliance with elites and oppressive
governments. Moreover, the ecumenical movement within
the Church provided an opening for the “working clergy,”
538those who had daily contact with the poor and saw
first-hand their conditions, to push the hierarchy to adopt a
more activist, reformist position. This group argued that
the Church needed to divorce itself from its alliance with
the rich and the powerful and to commit itself instead to
the struggle for social justice and to the task of raising the
awareness of the masses and making them understand that
they need not endure abuse in order to win salvation.
Activist priests, nuns, and lay people were determined to
unite as Christians and use the power of the Church to
change oppressive economic and political systems.
Years earlier, the Colombian priest Camilo Torres
(1929–66), convinced that guerrilla movements were the
only way to stop oppressive governments, joined the
communistled guerrilla National Liberation Army of
Colombia. Arguing that he was still a Catholic and
therefore could not be a communist, nor could he accept
atheism, Father Torres nonetheless joined the guerrillas
because they were the only group that was fighting
effectively against hunger, illiteracy, and poverty. He
believed in revolutionary change, going so far as to say,
“the Revolution is not only permitted but is obligatory for
all Christians who see in it the most effective way of
making possible a greater love for all men” (emphasis in
original).1
Father Torres’s association with the guerrilla
movement was a radical break from his upbringing. He
was from a very aristocratic, landowning family, and had
joined the priesthood and developed a reputation as a
scholar and teacher before he began to move to the left. He
died in February 1966 in a battle with the Colombian
military, having participated in a movement that did not
succeed in producing enduring change. Camilo Torres was
539nonetheless an inspirational figure, remembered as a poet
and an idealist, and something of a path breaker for the
role he played in proposing a radical alternative for
Catholic activists.
Marxism and Catholic Humanism
Father Torres was the forerunner of a new breed of
religious activists that was cropping up in the midst of
social struggles throughout the world, including South
Africa, the Philippines, and the United States. It was in
Latin America, however, that Marxist socialist ideology
mixed with radical grass-roots Catholic theory and practice
to produce a powerful new ideology. In Latin America,
Jesuits tended to be at the forefront of the movement for
social justice. As early as 1962 they published a newspaper
Mensaje (the Message) in Santiago, Chile, warning that the
people were tired of waiting for social change and calling
for a swift and thorough overhaul of the system. Mensaje,
while stopping short of directly advocating a socialist
program, nonetheless praised Marxists for their efforts in
attempting to create social equality.
The term “liberation theology” is thought to have
developed in 1964 at a meeting of Latin American
theologians held in Petrópolis, near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
at which Peruvian theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez (b. 1928)
defined religious ideology, or theology, as a reflection on
practice rather than as an interpretation of revealed truth
and scripture. The term “liberation theology” appeared in
various teachings, but became the label for the new
movement when Gutierrez’s book, A Theology of
Liberation: History, Politics, Salvation, was published in
540multiple languages in 1971. Soon an outpouring of
writings appeared from other theologians, among them
Brazil’s Leonardo Boff (b. 1938), Ignacio Ellacuría
(1930–89) in El Salvador, and Ernesto Cardenal (b. 1925)
in Nicaragua, interpreting and extending the meaning of
the new doctrine.
At the Second General Conference of Latin American
Episcopacy (CELAM, Consejo Episcopal Latino
Americano) in Medellín, Colombia in 1968, religious
activists urged the bishops to accept the doctrine of
“preferential option for the poor” as a strategy for
liberating the masses. Although the doctrine did not reject
work among members of any social class, the emphasis on
defending the poor as the direction for pastoral work was a
clear departure from past church practices, and also broke
from the fundamental classless theology on which
Catholicism was based. Liberation theologians pushed
practice as a way of recognizing theory, organizing the
faithful into Christian Base Communities (CEBs). These
grass-roots organizations brought the poor together to
study scripture as a guide to enacting social change. Thus
Christ’s teachings, along with socialist tracts, might form
the basis for a lesson in a CEB, which in turn would
organize community members to demand land, water
rights, better wages, an end to abuse, or to address other
grievances affecting participants.
Liberation theologians never accepted socialist doctrine in
its entirety, nor did they reject it, as did the Vatican. One
of the most important prelates in Latin America,
Archbishop Hélder Câmara (1909–99) of Recife, issued a
statement in 1968 signed by 25 bishops from throughout
541the developing world, declaring that socialism and
Christianity were not incompatible doctrines, calling on
the Church to speak out against the oppression of the poor,
and rejecting the systems of “feudalism, capitalism and
imperialism.” This statement inspired many of the most
left-wing among the liberation theologians to identify with
socialism. In a pastoral letter in July 1970, Bishop Sergio
Méndez Arceo (1907–92) of Cuernavaca, Mexico stated,
“I believe that a socialist system best conforms to Christian
principles of true brotherhood, justice, and peace.” Méndez
Arceo became known as the “Red Bishop.” Despite the
Vatican’s general hostility toward the leftward push in the
Latin American Church, Pope Paul VI (1897–1978) tried
to strike a conciliatory tone in his speech at the opening
session of the Medellín Bishops’ Conference by
denouncing the “international imperialism of money.” The
final statement affirmed the commitment of the Church to
the task of liberating the people of Latin America from
neocolonialism and “institutionalized violence,” a stance
that left the door open to cooperation with leftist
movements pushing for a radical social agenda. In April
1972 over 400 people, including 200 priests, came together
in the first convention of Christians for Socialism in
Santiago, Chile. Drawing on the teachings of the Jesuit
theologian Thomas Aquinas, they argued that violent
revolution may be necessary to overthrow tyrants.
Archbishop Oscar Romero (1917–80), who became the
movement’s leading martyr after his assassination in El
Salvador by right-wing death squads, stated in one of his
last sermons: “When all peaceful means have been
exhausted, the Church considers insurrection moral and
justified.”2
542The Opposition
Many people from all levels of the Church viewed this
trend of Christian socialism and religious-based political
activism with everything from skepticism to outright
hostility. In 1978 a new pope, John Paul II (1920–2005), a
Polish cardinal possibly less sympathetic to the leftist
clergy, began to alter the Vatican’s approach to the Latin
American Church. While outwardly accepting many of the
ideas of the liberation theologians, he disciplined,
demoted, and censored activist priests. For example, at the
Third CELAM meeting in Puebla, Mexico in 1978 he
stated that the Church condemns the “situation of inhuman
poverty in which millions of Latin Americans live, with
starvation wages, unemployment and underemployment,
malnutrition, infant mortality, lack of adequate housing,
health problems, and labor unrest.” He told a gathering of
40,000 Indians in Oaxaca that “you have a right to be
respected and not deprived of the little you have, often by
methods that amount to plunder,” a clear slap at the
Mexican government. At the same time, he publicly
reprimanded Father Ernesto Cardenal, a Trappist monk,
prominent advocate of liberation theology, and a member
of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, on a visit there
in 1980, and called the radical priest Father Leonardo Boff
from Brazil to a hearing at the Vatican and stripped him of
his authority. Boff subsequently left the priesthood. The
Vatican’s most outspoken critic of liberation theology was
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI; b.
1927), who saw radical priests as defying the power of
Rome and rejecting the hierarchy on which the Church
depended. As a cardinal, Ratzinger dismissed the “option
for the poor” as exclusionary and contrary to the mission
543of religion to address the needs of everyone: “All human
beings are poor. All people need spiritual sustenance; some
need material sustenance also”3
(1986).
The Somozas versus Sandino: the Next Generation
From the 1960s through the early 1990s, the struggle
between left and right played out fiercely in Nicaragua. On
the one side was a leftist liberation movement that
included Cuban-backed Marxists, Catholic priests and
religious workers influenced by liberation theology,
nationalist, middle-class advocates for change, and large
numbers of impoverished workers and peasants desperate
for an end to their misery. On the other was a
longstanding, entrenched dictatorship, powerful military,
conservative Catholic hierarchy, and tiny oligarchy
strongly backed by the US. The conflicts that ravaged
Nicaragua were the final chapter in the struggle for
sovereignty Augusto César Sandino had begun decades
earlier (see Chapter 9).
Following Sandino’s assassination in 1934 and subsequent
consolidation of the Somoza family dynasty, the potential
for Nicaraguan sovereignty and improved conditions for its
people all but disappeared. While Nicaragua had no major
export products that garnered a high price on the
international market – relying as it did on coffee, sugar,
cotton, and timber – the needs of its population of just 2.7
million could have been met on the basis of this revenue.
However, the Somoza family was stealing the nation’s
income and natural wealth out from under the people. By
1936 Anastásio Somoza García had consolidated his
power, organized around his own personal military group
544called the Blue Shirts. An admirer of Mussolini and Hitler,
Somoza employed his paramilitary shock troops to break
up demonstrations and strikes, and to threaten, apprehend,
jail, rough up, or kill anyone who persisted in opposing his
methods. Somoza García remained in the presidency until
1956, when a young poet assassinated him. He was
succeeded by his son, Luís Somoza Debayle, and
eventually by his grandson, Anastásio Somoza Debayle,
who held power until he was ousted in 1979. Except for a
few years when caretaker presidents held office, Somozas
directly controlled the presidency and the National Guard
for over 40 years.
By 1970 the Somoza family controlled about 25 percent of
agriculture and a large proportion of industry, leaving their
wealth estimated at $500 million in a country where annual
per-capita income was just $256. This level of extreme
control had always generated an opposition, but it grew
more vocal in the 1960s. Middle-class entrepreneurs,
professionals, and small landholders, and even a scattering
of large landowners, resented the petty regulations and
constant shakedowns in the form of bribes and “gifts” to
the family to obtain standard services. The working class
chafed under repressive labor policies, and the majority of
poor and landless peasants, well over 50 percent of the
population, grew increasingly desperate as they faced year
after year of hunger, disease, and poverty. In addition,
Catholic priests and nuns, who in the past had sided with
the elite, began to raise criticisms of the degradation
endured by the country’s majority.
The Sandinista Opposition
545In 1961 three university students and political activists,
Carlos Fonseca (1936–76), Silvio Mayorga (1936–67), and
Tomás Borge (b. 1930), formed the Sandinista National
Liberation Front (FSLN, Frente Sandinista de Liberación
Nacional), named for Augusto Sandino, the hero of the
anti-US campaign of the 1930s. The FSLN, also known as
the Sandinistas or simply the Frente, attracted support
from trade unions, community groups, peasants, women,
youth and religious organizations, and eventually formed a
guerrilla wing centered in mountainous areas outside the
major cities of Managua, Masaya, and León. The FSLN
was in the foreground of popular consciousness inside and
outside the country. As the guerrilla movement’s stature
rose, Somoza’s declined, leading some observers to
wonder if the old dictator had outlasted his staying power.
The first event was a massive earthquake in December
1972 that killed 10,000 people, destroyed the entire center
of the capital of Managua, reduced to rubble most homes,
businesses, and hospitals, and left thousands without
water, electricity, housing, or medical care. In response to
the catastrophe, more than 25 countries sent millions of
dollars in aid, although by early 1973 international relief
agencies reported that much of the aid was not reaching
the victims. As with other high-profile disasters, celebrities
jumped in to raise money for the relief effort, including the
Rolling Stones who raised $350,000 at a benefit concert in
London in early 1973. The Stones rarely performed
benefits, but this time they did so at the request of lead
singer Mick Jagger’s then wife and native of Nicaragua,
Bianca Morena Jagger (b. 1950). Major League baseball
player, Roberto Clemente (1934–72), a native of Puerto
Rico, became intensely involved in raising money and
546assistance for the earthquake victims, but died when the
small plane in which he was transporting goods crashed.
The earthquake and the international relief effort it
spawned served to focus attention on Nicaragua, and thus
on the corrupt practices of the Somoza government.
International criticism of the regime mounted as it became
clear that Somoza had funneled relief money into his own
pockets, using it to buy up land around the capital and then
selling it at a profit to proprietors looking to restart their
businesses. Pedro Joaquín Chamorro (1924–78), an
outspoken critic of the regime from one the country’s
oldest families and editor of La Prensa, Nicaragua’s
leading newspaper, published a series of articles revealing
a scheme by which Somoza was profiting from selling
abroad blood plasma intended for earthquake victims. La
Prensa’s exposé of Somoza’s bold-faced graft was
particularly effective because the newspaper and its editor
were highly respected at home and abroad. Criticism
turned to outrage when in January 1978 gunmen killed
Chamorro at point-blank range as he was traveling through
the ruins of Managua. Since no one doubted Somoza’s role
in the popular editor’s assassination, the event provoked a
widespread outcry in Nicaragua. Many people argued that
if a man of such high social standing could be killed, then
no critic was safe from Somoza’s henchmen. Nora Astorga
(1948–88), a young lawyer who in her twenties worked
initially clandestinely and later as a part of the guerrilla
command, commented on the impact of Chamorro’s death:
I finally understood that armed struggle was the only
solution, that a rifle cannot be met with a flower, that we
were in the streets, but if that force didn’t get organized we
547wouldn’t achieve much... For me, it was the moment of
conviction: either I took up arms and made a total
commitment or I wasn’t going to change anything.4
Meanwhile the Sandinistas had demonstrated enormous
success in mobilizing international support for their
campaign to oust Somoza and were enjoying widespread
approval within the country. In December 1974 the Frente
stormed a Christmas party at the house of one of
Managua’s leading politicians where hundreds of the
wealthiest people in the country, including Somoza
himself, the US ambassador to Nicaragua, and other
friends of the regime were in attendance. Surrounding the
party, the guerrillas took 40 guests hostage, who they
traded for a $5 million ransom, the release of 15 political
prisoners, and safe passage to Havana. Although Somoza
and the US ambassador had already left the party, the
guerrillas’ ability to penetrate the mansion’s tight security
system – and the later revelation that it was actually the
daughter of the host, a clandestine Frente sympathizer,
who had provided access – caused many in high circles to
doubt Somoza’s chances of defeating the guerrillas.
In August 1978, eight months after Chamorro’s
assassination, the world’s attention was again drawn to a
spectacular Sandinista action. On a sunny morning in
August, 25 guerrillas surrounded and invaded the National
Palace under the command of a brilliant military strategist,
Edén Pastora (b. 1937), known as Comandante Cero
(Commander Zero, his code name for the operation).
Disguised as National Guardsmen, they killed the real
Guards, seized most members of the Chamber of Deputies
as it was in session (including Somoza’s half-brother), and
548held them and some 2,000 public employees for ransom.
Before the hostages were released, the Frente had obtained
the freedom and safe passage to Panama for 59 of their
comrades and a ransom in the millions of dollars. Just as
the year before the death of Pedro Chamorro had signaled
that no one was safe from Somoza’s assassins, the August
seizure of the National Palace revealed that the Sandinistas
were able to penetrate the inner reaches of the government,
that they had widespread support in Nicaragua, and that a
neighboring country, Panama, was willing to provide
refuge. In fact, most Latin American governments were
concluding that Somoza was in his final days.
As the Sandinista armies, a number of them under the
command of female officers, encircled the capital of
Managua in late June 1979 (Figure 13.1), US President
Jimmy Carter made a final appeal to the OAS to send a
peacekeeping force to Managua to negotiate power away
from the FSLN and force them to include business and
political elements friendly to Somoza in the new
government. Much to the embarrassment of the US envoy,
the OAS unanimously refused to cooperate; the US failed
even to win the support of staunch allies such as the
dictators of the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Chile, and
Argentina. Finally, when a National Guardsman was
caught on camera shooting a correspondent for Time
magazine, the Carter Administration withdrew its support.
Somewhat contemptuously, Nicaraguans pointed out that
Somoza’s National Guard had killed thousands of their
fellow citizens with bullets supplied by the US
government, but it took just one photograph of the Guard
killing a US citizen for decades of military and political
support to come to a halt. On July 16 Somoza received
549asylum in Stroessner’s Paraguay, where he lived until his
assassination in 1980 at the hands of a faction of the
Argentine guerrilla movement. The bulk of Somoza’s
National Guard retreated to neighboring Honduras, after
first bombing much of the country. The FSLN and its allies
entered Managua on July 18, 1979, and were greeted with
a gigantic celebration.
When the euphoria receded, the triumphant guerrillas
faced the Herculean task of rebuilding a country
devastated by a war that had killed 50,000 people (2
percent of the population), and wreaked destruction
estimated at $1.3 billion, including large sections of the
ruined capital city that had never recovered from the
earthquake nearly five years earlier. When they entered the
offices of the president, the new leaders discovered that
Somoza had looted the national treasury of $1.6 billion,
most of which he deposited in US banks. Nicaragua never
managed to retrieve the bulk of the stolen treasury from
uncooperative US banks, despite Somoza’s frequent
presence in Miami.

550Sandinistas in Power
The Sandinistas quickly announced a nine-member
coalition government, comprised of Marxist FSLN leaders,
including Tomás Borge, the only founding member of the
Frente to have survived the war, two bankers, two Catholic
priests who had lived for years in the US, and Violeta
Chamorro (b. 1929), widow of the slain newspaper editor.
Daniel Ortega Saavedra (b. 1945), the leader of the
Sandinista political wing, headed the government, while
his brother Humberto (b. 1942) commanded the armed
forces. Moving cautiously, and hopeful of obtaining
support from the US and Western European democracies,
the revolutionary government eschewed some of the more
drastic steps that had characterized the early days of the
Cuban Revolution. It outlawed capital punishment and
instituted a program to “rehabilitate” any members of the
551Nicaraguan military who wished to remain in the country,
so long as they were loyal to the new government.
The ruling coalition introduced a mixed public-private
capitalist economy, maintaining 60 percent of all holdings
in private hands; began a process of land reform that
sought to distribute 80 percent of the land to small farmers;
and left 75 percent of manufacturing under private
ownership. The new rules also included payment of
minimum wages, regulated working hours, safety
practices, maternity leave, child care, and pensions. These
measures immediately generated opposition from both
landowners and manufacturers, who claimed that it was
impossible to manage their business without the freedom
to impose their own conditions. Over the next few years,
workers and owners entered into a long series of disputes
over what constituted acceptable living and working
conditions. In defiance of the government, some firms
closed and owners took their capital with them to the
United States or elsewhere; others scaled back production
in hopes of waiting out the government and/or sabotaged
production. By 1983 Nicaragua was experiencing an 11.7
percent decline in the output of private industry, and 44
firms had abandoned the country. When domestic and
international firms shut down, arguing that paying a living
wage cut into their profits, the US government and media
accused the Sandinistas of unfairly limiting the freedom of
corporate and business interests. When firms and
landowners left their property behind, the Nicaraguan
government took them over and ran them either as
agricultural cooperatives or state-owned businesses,
generating further accusations from domestic
conservatives and external critics.
552By 1980 more than 50,000 workers had been added to the
state sector, accounting for 20 percent of coffee
production, 15 percent of cotton, and 15 percent of
livestock. During 1979–80 the state moved immediately to
stimulate small enterprise: private farmers accounted for
87.2 percent of production of maize, 79.1 percent of beans,
73 percent of livestock, 30 percent of cotton, and 18
percent of coffee. Despite accusations that Nicaragua was
massively collectivizing and driving out individual
entrepreneurs, the majority of land ownership and
production remained in private hands. Nonetheless, a small
country like Nicaragua, which had for its entire modern
existence been oriented toward exporting primary goods, is
always vulnerable to variations in international prices and
demand and natural disasters that affect supply. Shortly
after the triumph of the revolution, Nicaragua was faced
with a fall in global sugar prices, followed by floods in
1982 and drought later that year that destroyed or limited
agricultural output, especially coffee. The major threat to
economic stability, however, was the war on Nicaragua by
CIA-funded counter-insurgents, made up primarily of
former National Guard officers (see Box 13.1). This force,
known as the “Contras,” was never strong enough to win, a
fact that the CIA always admitted; however, it wreaked
havoc on the economic and political life of Nicaragua from
the early 1980s until the election of 1990.
Despite its many problems, after just a few years the
revolution had begun to show significant gains. A 1983
United Nations survey of conditions in Nicaragua showed
real improvement, including a 40 percent increase in
individual food consumption, 50 percent reduction in
urban rents, doubling of school enrollment, and a 28.7
553percent reduction in infant mortality rates. That same year
Nicaragua was awarded UNESCO’s top prize for its
literacy campaign. Prior to 1979 half of all adults were
illiterate; the number dropped to 12 percent by 1983.
These improvements came about in several ways. In the
first place, copying the successful literacy program
initiated in Cuba after the 1959 revolution, Nicaragua
called for educated volunteers from urban areas to travel to
remote villages throughout the country to teach basic
literacy. Not only were peasants and workers anxious to
learn, they studied hard, displayed enormous motivation,
and learned quickly. Maintaining high literacy levels was
harder, since the state needed to establish schools and
supply paid teachers everywhere in Nicaragua, a task that
required investment and expertise beyond the parameters
of the first literacy movement.
Box 13.1 The new face of Sandinismo: Nora
Astorga
During the many years of war against Somoza, a
number of women rose to prominent positions in
the FSLN leadership. One of the most daring was
Nora Astorga. A lawyer, politician, judge, and later
Nicaragua’s Ambassador to the United Nations
(1986–8), Astorga was the poster child for the
empowerment of women involved in guerrilla
struggles. Born to a prosperous, conservative,
religious family in Managua, Astorga shocked her
parents when she refused to support Anastasio
554Somoza in 1967. Although she was sent to study in
the United States in hopes of changing her mind
politically, the visit seems to have had the opposite
effect. She returned to Nicaragua and became a
lawyer in a government ministry, providing
information to the Sandinistas. Astorga gained
national, even international, prominence as a
pivotal figure in the assassination of General Pérez
Vega, deputy commander of the National Guard,
one of Somoza’s closest military advisors, and a
man widely known for his brutal tactics. On March
8, 1978, (International Women’s Day) Astorga
finally agreed to Pérez Vega’s persistent entreaties
for a sexual liaison. In a prearranged trap, she
invited him to her house where three Sandinista
commanders seized him from her bedroom. While
the plan had been to hold the general for ransom,
he put up such a struggle that he was murdered. No
longer safe as an above-ground operative, Astorga
left that day to join the Sandinista command in the
mountains.
After the victory, Nora Astorga served as Vice
Minister of Justice presiding over the trials of
former National Guardsmen. President Ronald
Reagan rejected her 1984 appointment as
Nicaragua’s Ambassador to the US because of her
role in Pérez Vega’s death (the general had been a
CIA informant). So Astorga became ambassador to
the UN, where she was instrumental in gaining
555support for a World Court decision that declared
US support of the Contras illegal. Nora Astorga
died of cancer in 1988. Asked if she regretted her
role in Pérez Vega’s death, she replied, “It was not
murder. He was too much of a monster... He really
was a monster. I understood his death as part of the
liberation struggle.”
From “Nora Astorga In Her Own Words,” Revista
Envío (Digital), No. 82, April 1988.
Second, Nicaragua benefited from an outpouring of
material aid, volunteers, and expertise from individuals in
Europe, Japan, and the United States. Members of the
large Nicaraguan exile community in the US held
fundraisers for organizations back home; some returned to
bring money and goods to relatives or to work in
construction and education projects. Volunteers from
foreign-based human rights, progressive and religious
organizations, as well as doctors, nurses, and college
students traveled to Nicaragua to show solidarity with the
attempts to improve the health, education, and general
welfare of the people. Typical was a nurse from a small
town in upstate New York who recruited volunteers from
her local health maintenance organization to contribute
medicines and spend their vacation time in rural villages of
the highlands, helping to coordinate vaccination programs.
In addition, the Netherlands, Scandinavian countries, and
Canada entered into formal agreements with the new
government, providing loans and other financial
556assistance, as well as teams of medical personnel,
agronomists, educators, and engineers.
The largest amount of assistance on a state-to-state level
came from Cuba. Naturally delighted at the victory of
another guerrilla force in Latin America, especially one
with some leaders that embraced Marxism and
anti-imperialism, Cuba was anxious to solidify its ties with
Nicaragua as a way of breaking out of its own isolation.
Throughout the decades of fighting, the Cuban government
had provided political advice, military training, material
aid, exile, and a place for guerrillas to take an occasional
break from the war. Defining Nicaragua’s relations with
Cuba, however, was an extremely sensitive matter for the
Sandinistas, who knew that close association with Cuba –
even accepting medical aid – would antagonize the US and
serve as justification for opposing the new government.
Because the standard complaint of the US toward Cuba
was that Fidel Castro did not stand for election, the
Sandinistas were careful to hold elections. In 1984 Daniel
Ortega won the presidency with 60 percent of the vote, a
slightly higher margin than Ronald Reagan’s (1911–2004)
victory over Walter Mondale (b. 1928) the same year.
United States and the Sandinistas
Relations with the US were strained from the very
beginning. Following the Sandinista victory, during the
remaining six months of the Carter Administration, the US
maintained an embassy; maintained cordial relations,
including trade; and offered a loan of $75 million –
exclusively for the private sector. When the Reagan
Administration entered office in January 1980, however, it
557adopted a hostile tone toward Nicaragua – including
placing a freeze on the $15 million left on the loan, but not
breaking off relations. However, the Reagan White House
immediately set about undermining the government by
arming and training a group of soldiers (mostly from
Somoza’s National Guard) on bases in Honduras, from
which they launched a “secret war” to overthrow the
Sandinistas. The blatant illegality of the move, as well as
widespread disagreement with the policy among the
American population, eventually led Congress to cut off all
funding for the Contras.
Since Congress had cut off money for military aid to the
Contras, a particularly important project of President
Ronald Reagan, the Office of National Security devised a
secret plan to sell weapons to Iran, a country with which
the US had no diplomatic relations, as a way of obtaining
the release of a group of American hostages. Originally the
transactions passed through Israel, but later they were
negotiated directly between the US administration and
Iran. Under the direction of Marine Lieutenant Colonel
Oliver North (b. 1943), the weapons were marked up
anywhere from 15 to 40 percent, thereby rendering a
healthy profit that could be funneled to the Contras and
more than compensated for the funds the
Democratic-controlled Congress had ended. For its part,
Iran was willing to pay any price for arms to carry out its
six-year-long war with Iraq, a war in which the US,
ironically, was supplying President Saddam Hussein’s
(1937–2006) Iraqi military.
By 1986 the operation, called the Iran-Contra affair or
sometimes Irangate, was fully exposed and laid out before
558the American public in a series of televised Congressional
hearings in which Oliver North; his boss, Admiral John
Poindexter (b. 1936); Reagan’s National Security Advisor,
Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger (1917–2006);
CIA Director William Casey (1913–87); Undersecretary of
State for Latin American Affairs, Elliott Abrams (b. 1948);
and other officials of the Reagan White House detailed,
denied, protested, and parried their role in the remarkable
scheme in response to the committee’s questions.
Eventually the office of Special Prosecutor Lawrence
Walsh brought the principals in the case to trial, but the
convictions of Oliver North and John Poindexter were
overturned on appeal on technical grounds, and Casper
Weinberger and others were pardoned by President George
H. W. Bush (b. 1924), who had been vice-president under
Reagan. CIA Director Casey died of a brain tumor, and
several others of those convicted, such as Elliott Abrams
(whose role in the affair was that he flew to London using
a fake name and passport to solicit a $10 million
contribution for the Contras from the Sultan of Brunei)
were pardoned. Abrams was subsequently appointed
deputy national security advisor for the Near East in the
administration of George Bush (b. 1946).
For years President Reagan denied any knowledge of the
Iran-Contra affair, leaving him open to accusations of
negligence, but not necessarily wrongdoing. Eventually, on
March 4, 1987 in a televised press conference the
President admitted his knowledge of the scheme, stated
that his previous assertion that the US did not trade arms
for hostages was inaccurate, and said that Vice-President
Bush (a former director of the CIA) knew of the plan.
Reagan’s personal popularity with the electorate
559undermined the Democratic opposition’s political will to
punish any wrongdoing.
Effects of the Contra War
The Contras were never successful in overturning the
Nicaraguan government, but they did succeed in disrupting
society, destroying infrastructure, bleeding the life out of
the revolution, and exhausting the population to the extent
that Daniel Ortega lost the presidency in February 1990.
The United States donated over $300 million to opposition
candidate Violeta Chamorro, an early member of the
Sandinista directorate who later parted ways with the
leadership and went on to win the election. Initially
observers inside and outside Nicaragua were astounded at
the Sandinistas’ defeat, but in the weeks after the elections
the underlying motives became clearer. First, voters
believed that Chamorro’s election was the country’s only
way to end the Contra war. Second, internal strife
exacerbated divisions among the leadership, leading to
accusations that the Ortegas were enriching themselves
while the majority of Nicaraguans lived in deprivation.
The fact that many Sandinistas had come from prosperous
families and could move back into sumptuous homes
angered many and sowed dissension.
Gioconda Belli (b. 1948), in her account of the struggle,
The Country Under My Skin, places the blame for many of
the Sandinistas’ failures on the Ortegas and other members
of the inner leadership whose arrogance, sexism, and
self-importance separated them from the day-to-day life of
ordinary people. Ultimately, many who had hoped for
change saw only defeat, arguing that the only way out was
560to reach a compromise with the Contras and attempt to
salvage what was left of the reforms. Even with
widespread international support, including victories at the
World Court and United Nations that found the US
culpable of carrying out illegal acts of aggression against
the tiny country, many Nicaraguans felt they could never
effectively fight off the anti-Sandinista forces within the
country. For many people, the prospect of peace was a
powerful incentive and, they argued, electing Violeta
Chamorro president did not mean a return to the Somoza
regime.
Under her presidency the war against the Contras ended
immediately, and Chamorro was able to negotiate for
foreign aid and loans from the IMF and Inter-American
Development Bank. Consistent with the neoliberal
economic policy that triumphed in the post-Cold War
years, bankers advocated a development strategy based on
privatization of resources and massive cuts to social
services. Real wages, never adequate in the past, fell and
unemployment rose to the point that the CIA World
Factbook lists the distribution of income in Nicaragua as
one of the most unequal on the planet. Absolute poverty,
malnutrition, preventable disease, and illiteracy have
increased in the last decade, while the country’s meager
resources have been devoted to servicing the debt. Adding
to these woes, in October 1998 Hurricane Mitch, one of
the deadliest hurricanes in Atlantic history, caused massive
death and destruction, exacerbating the longstanding state
of disrepair in Nicaragua’s infrastructure after previous
natural catastrophes and the Contra war.
561A key Reagan Administration rationale for funding the
Contras rested on its claim that the Sandinistas were
assisting rebels in El Salvador, the Farabundo Martí
National Liberation Front (FMLN), who were trying to
overthrow a corrupt military dictatorship. Although
Nicaragua consistently denied the claim and the US never
proved it, the assertion worked well enough with the US
Congress to allow the White House to pursue its
semi-legal, and even illegal, war. Later the Sandinistas
admitted that they did aid the FMLN initially, asserting
that it was their right to assist a neighboring country and
that the overthrow of the Salvadoran dictatorship was
necessary for their own revolution to survive.
Central America in Turmoil: El Salvador and Guatemala
Like Nicaragua, El Salvador is a very small country that
has long suffered from gross income inequalities. It was
ruled by a tiny elite and thrust into the very center of
international policymaking because of the guerrilla war
that raged from the 1970s until 1992. With a population of
almost seven million people in a space about the size of
Massachusetts, El Salvador is the most densely populated
nation of the region. The poor own less than two percent of
the land, and the most productive acreage is in the hands of
the country’s so-called “Fourteen Families,” the economic
and political elite. Like Nicaragua, El Salvador’s treasury
depends heavily on a small number of agricultural exports,
especially coffee, sugar, beans, and corn, as well as
processed foods and textiles.
While El Salvador and Nicaragua were both essentially
police states, they differed in key ways, and should also be
562seen in contrast to neighboring Guatemala. The Somoza
dynasty operated essentially as a stand-in for the United
States, like Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic and
Fulgencio Batista in Cuba. These military men were not
part of the elite, nor had they risen to power as a result of
their relationship with wealthy landowners, many of whom
scorned them as crude upstarts. Rather, they achieved their
positions based on their subservience to the United States
military, each having been personally selected for his
position by a US envoy. The prescient comment of
Franklin Roosevelt in reference to Anastásio Somoza sums
up the relationship: “He may be a son of a bitch, but he’s
our son of a bitch.”
In both El Salvador and Guatemala, however, the ruling
elite had evolved as a force in their own right, not as a
stand-in for the US. As a result, the local oligarchy had
generated their own loyal armies and ruled with the
interests of their class at the forefront, although they were
quick to call on the US (as Guatemala’s elite did in 1954)
if they proved unable to manage their affairs alone. El
Salvador’s Fourteen Families had retained control, without
much assistance or concern from the US, for most of the
twentieth century. They had put down the peasant uprising
of 1932 without outside assistance, while the ominous
memory of Farabundo Martí’s popularity galvanized them.
Guatemala had far more involvement with the US than El
Salvador, but, with the exception of the short experiments
with democracy under Arévalo and Arbenz in the 1940s
and 1950s, Guatemala’s oligarchy was in charge of its own
military affairs. And just as the Salvadoran elite
remembered in horror the uprising of 1932, so too the
Guatemalan counterparts had memories of the late 1940s
563and early 1950s. These attempts at change gave purpose to
and unified the respective governments. Finally, unlike
pre-1979 Nicaragua, the ruling classes of Guatemala and
El Salvador probably experienced less disaffection or
disloyalty from the members of younger generations, many
of whom coalesced around far-right goals and objectives.
There were, of course, some significant cracks in the elite
alliance and some individuals broke with the rightists and
even joined the left opposition.
Politics of Repression in El Salvador
For most of the 1970s Salvadoran democratic forces
attempted to influence the military government, but were
largely unsuccessful. In 1972, in the face of 60 percent
inflation and 30 percent unemployment, a coalition of
opposition parties formed to run against the oligarchy’s
official candidate. A number of parties, spanning the
ideological spectrum from moderate-right Christian
Democrats to more moderate-left, to the Communist left,
came together in a united front, the Unión Nacional
Opósitora (UNO, Union of National Opposition). The
coalition ran a candidate in the national elections, a centrist
businessman named José Napoleon Duarte (1925–90).
Duarte won the election by some 72,000 votes, but the
electoral commission overturned the results and, despite a
complete lack of evidence, declared the conservative
candidate, Colonel Arturo Armando Molina (b. 1927), the
victor by 100,000 votes. To prevent Duarte from
contesting the results, the military had him arrested,
tortured, and exiled to Venezuela, where he remained until
his return to El Salvador in the late 1970s. Molina’s
government was known for its friendliness to the interests
564of foreign investors, export companies, landowners, and
anyone who supported his repressive rule. Reminiscent of
Mexico’s disastrous decision to host the Olympics in 1968
in hopes of defusing domestic discontent, Colonel Molina
managed to host the Miss Universe pageant in 1975, a feat
that cost $30 million. As in Mexico, there were outcries
over the costliness of the event, given El Salvador’s
pressing social and economic problems. Also similar to
Mexico, the military fired on protestors, killing 37 in the
days leading up to the pageant.
Inequality grew during the 1970s. In 1960 about 12
percent of the peasantry, which forms the overwhelming
majority of the nation’s population, had no land. This
figure had grown to 80 percent by the mid-1970s. In
response to their misery, and having been left with few
alternatives, peasants and urban workers – with
considerable aid from the increasingly radical Catholic
clergy – began in the 1970s to organize and protest their
condition. On February 15, 1977 the police and military
opened fire on a peaceful protest in San Salvador, killing
200 people as they scrambled to shelter inside the
cathedral on the central plaza. Captured on film by the
international press covering the event, the scene was
shown on the nightly news throughout the world and raised
doubts in the US about the nature of the Salvadoran
government and questions about the millions of dollars in
military and humanitarian aid being sent to prop it up.
The event was pivotal in the life of El Salvador’s leading
Catholic cleric, Archbishop Óscar Romero. The
Archbishop had been an outspoken critic of the Salvadoran
military, having been convinced by the murders of priests
565trying to assist the poor that the government was doing
nothing to curb the brutality of the military and
paramilitary death squads. In 1980 he angered high
authorities in the government, in the Catholic Church in
Rome, and in Washington by calling for an end to US
military aid to his country, arguing that so long as the state
received assistance it would continue to murder innocent
civilians. When he called on individual soldiers in El
Salvador to disobey their superior officer death threats
turned to reality. On March 24, 1980 he was assassinated
while saying evening mass. Since the order to kill such a
prominent figure in Salvadoran society would have had to
be cleared at the very top of the military chain of
command, it has been assumed that it came come from the
head of the far right ARENA party (Alianza Republicana
Nacionalista or National Republican Alliance), Roberto
D’Aubuisson. Robert White, US Ambassador to El
Salvador during the Carter Administration, called
D’Aubuisson a “pathological killer,” citing his consistent
involvement with the death squads.
In November 1980 one of the few members of the
Fourteen Families who formed part of the opposition,
Enrique Alvarez (1930–80), was murdered when he and
others returned from exile, after a pledge that they could
participate in elections. The following month, four US
religious workers, including three nuns who had been
ministering to the poor, were raped and murdered by the
paramilitaries. By the mid-1980s support for the
Salvadoran government and military, estimated at over
$200 million, was highly unpopular among US citizens.
Not only the expense, but the reports of human rights
abuses, news footage of atrocities committed in broad
566daylight, and the deaths of Catholic workers and priests, as
well as two USAID technicians who were shot
execution-style while sitting in a downtown hotel café.
During one 12-month period in 1980–1, death squads
reportedly killed 30,000 civilians, the rough equivalent of
killing more than 2 million people in the United States.
Death squad violence, growing malnutrition and misery
from failed land policies, the battle between the
government and opposition forces, and extremely high
rates of unemployment spurred more than 500,000
Salvadorans to migrate to the US. Most entered illegally,
settling in Los Angeles and other California cities. The Los
Angeles County Department of Public Health reported in
1984 that the Salvadoran and Guatemalan populations
arriving in the Los Angeles area displayed “the common
characteristics of malnutrition and disease encountered in
other refugee populations, but also never-before seen signs
of a terrorized people” (LA Times). When US immigration
authorities turned away Salvadoran asylum seekers, local
authorities stepped in to provide refuge. Over 400 cities
throughout the US were convinced by religious
denominations and peace activists to declare themselves
“sanctuaries”; local authorities stepped in to protect
Central American (mostly Salvadoran and Guatemalan)
refugees from arrest and deportation.
The Opposition
In 1981 a new Salvadoran opposition united along a broad
set of principles into a Frente, or popular front coalition.
Like the Sandinistas, they adopted the name of the martyr
from the 1930s, Farabundo Martí, and organized under the
567banner of the FMLN (Frente Farabundo Martí de
Liberación Nacional), with an above-ground wing, the
Frente Democratico Revolucionario (FDR, Democratic
Revolutionary Front) based in Costa Rica. The FMLN
struggled against enormous odds for over a decade,
fighting throughout the country, gaining control of
provinces outside the capital, and engaging in
cat-and-mouse guerrilla tactics with a very well-equipped
Salvadoran army. Despite the latter’s abundant supply of
money, arms, and expert advice from Washington, and the
common knowledge that the guerrillas fought with
weapons, uniforms, and materiel captured from fallen
soldiers, neither side was able to reach a decisive victory.
The military had virtually no support from the citizenry,
except when terrorized or forced to aid them; the guerrillas
had more support, but lacked sufficient arms to launch a
full-scale assault on the capital. Many civilians had cause
to fear getting involved, since recriminations by the
military for aiding the insurgents were severe.
The difficulty of fighting an extremely brutal military
government, combined with the political idealism of the
liberation movement’s intense struggle for unity, meant
that the movement itself fell prone to the very violence and
intransigence it was resisting. In 1975 one of El Salvador’s
leading writers, Roque Dalton (1935–75), became a
member of the People’s Revolutionary Army (ERP,
Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo) over the opposition of
other leading Salvadoran revolutionaries who thought he
better served the cause with his politically charged poetry.
In 1975 he was accused of being a double agent for the
CIA and executed. The charges were never proved and the
murder stands as one of the bleakest moments in the
568history of El Salvador. Roque Dalton is today on a postage
stamp. Less than ten years later, Mélida Anaya Montes, a
leading figure in another organization that formed a part of
the FMLN was assassinated in a heated struggle for
leadership. Her death then led to the suicide of the group’s
founding leader, Salvador Cayetano Cárpio. Although
every movement for social change engenders intense
rivalries, the FMLN has a particularly bloody and
combative history. The futility of these killings is
horrendous, mitigated and comprehensible only in the
violent context in which they occurred.
The war in El Salvador was widely reported in the
international press, and several TV and feature movies
appeared in the US and abroad detailing the events there.
Director Oliver Stone’s film, Salvador, is based on the real
life story of a ne’er-do-well Los Angeles drug dealer,
Richard Boyle, who co-wrote the script with Stone. Boyle
and his sidekick Doc travel to El Salvador looking for
women, drugs, and fun only to be shocked at the carnage
they encounter. The movie was (and still is) an especially
astute portrayal of the tremendous, and often devastating,
effect of US foreign policy on people in a distant and tiny
country, unbeknownst to, and often of little concern to,
most Americans.
In spite of the negative publicity, Washington remained
firmly in support of various Salvadoran administrations,
both civilian and military, claiming that to pull out would
mean turning power over to the far right. Nonetheless,
efforts to find a more moderate group or political leader
proved elusive. Religious, human rights and relief workers
attempted in vain to convince the US Congress to end all
569aid, pointing out that anything that entered El Salvador
was funneled immediately to the military, police, and
various corrupt government agencies that were carrying
out, or facilitating, the killing.
The Fighting Ends
After 12 years of fighting, the war was ended through a
negotiated settlement that paved the way for elections. In
1992 the FMLN disarmed; in 1994 they emerged as the
second largest political force in the national assembly.
When the peace treaty in El Salvador was signed in 1992,
the US had spent $4 billion propping up the Salvadoran
government and 75,000 people – the majority civilians –
were dead. If the US public was confused about where
their money went and what had happened in El Salvador,
the United Nations was not. In March 1993 the body
issued a report stating that the responsibility for the
killings of thousands of Salvadoran civilians in the civil
war must be assigned to senior military figures in the
army, strongly backed by the United States.
Since the early 1990s, El Salvador has become a prime
location for clothing, sporting goods, and other
“sweatshop” manufacturers. One of the poorest countries
of the world, El Salvador relies heavily today on
remittances from immigrants, mainly in the US since the
1980s. The money Salvadorans send to relatives back
home amounts to 17 percent of the nation’s GDP. Despite
the end of the civil war, El Salvador has not overcome the
hardship, misery, and poverty that fueled the rebellion in
the first place. Ecological devastation has been particularly
acute as a result of the wars and agricultural practices that
570relegate the most productive land to Salvador’s Fourteen
Families, keeping the majority landless. Given the
country’s small size and heavy population density, the
resultant crowding has led to overuse and widespread soil
exhaustion. In the twenty-first century the former
guerrillas remain an important group on the Salvadoran
political landscape with a plurality in both national and
local political offices. In March 2009 FMLN candidate
Mauricio Funes won the presidential elections.
Nonetheless, years of fighting have strained the already
contentious coalition, which, combined with economic
woes, serves to undermine the government’s effectiveness.
Guatemala: The Bloodiest War
Events in Guatemala in many ways paralleled those in El
Salvador, except that the country’s military government
carried out such extreme human rights violations that even
the US distanced itself from this close ally. The liberation
movement of the 1970s and 1980s coalesced around
various groups, including organizations seeking
indigenous rights, trade unions and communities affiliated
with the Catholic Church, human rights and
pro-democracy advocates. Similar to El Salvador, but
unlike Nicaragua, no single military dictator controlled
Guatemala; rather a series of repressive regimes ruled from
the time of the CIA-sponsored coup that ousted Arbenz in
1954. The largest of the Central American republics, with
a population of slightly more than 12 million, Guatemala
relied on a servile Maya labor force to produce the coffee,
cotton, and fruits that served as the main agricultural
exports. Guatemala City became the site of a considerable
amount of foreign investment in the automotive, beverage,
571textile, and pharmaceutical industries, which were
attracted by the plentiful supply of cheap labor in a country
where trade unions were either outlawed or severely
circumscribed.
For a period of time the US Congress refused to supply
Guatemala with aid, but observers have maintained that
support entered through third parties, especially Israelis,
who were enlisted to carry out training and supply arms to
the Guatemalan government in return for US generosity
toward Israel. In a well-known book, Rigoberta Menchu, a
Maya peace activist who was awarded the 1992 Nobel
Peace Prize, publicized the extent of the genocidal policies
toward indigenous people (see Box 13.2).
Box 13.2 Rigoberta Menchú and the controversial
story of a Guatemalan woman
Rigoberta Menchu told her story to Elizabeth
Burgos Debray, an anthropologist who published
the account of the murderous rampage of the
Guatemalan military against the indigenous people
over several decades. In her introduction to I,
Rigoberta Menchu, she states: “My story is the
story of all poor Guatemalans. My personal
experience is the reality of a whole people.” With
the publication of Rigoberta Menchu’s testimonio
in 1983, the 23-year-old Guatemalan Quiche-Maya
woman became a leader and the voice for the
indigenous people of her country. Because of the
572power and the moving content of her story,
Menchu became a celebrity; her book was widely
read, and in 1992 she received the Nobel Peace
Prize. Rigoberta Menchu became the international
champion of indigenous women’s rights.
Along with her fame came criticism. US
anthropologist David Stoll wrote in his book
Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of All Poor
Guatemalans that Menchu purposely distorted her
story, included events she never witnessed but
stated that she had, and grossly exaggerated other
moments. Stoll based his argument on interviews
with people in Guatemala who had witnessed the
events Menchu described. For example, he reports
that Menchu’s detailed account of the gruesome
death of her brother at the hands of the military
never occurred, and that her description of a
conflict between her father and the government
over land titles was instead a property dispute with
in-laws. Ultimately, Stoll claims that the book is a
leftist apology for the guerrilla movement that was
shaped by Menchu’s own political agenda and
ideology.
During the ensuing controversy, some writers have
sided with David Stoll, arguing that the testimony
is marred by exaggerations and untruths and thus
not a believable account – although no one disputes
the brutal murder and displacement of thousands of
573Quiche-Maya people. Others, including many
anthropologists with extensive experience in the
region, have come to Rigoberta Menchu’s defense.
Their view is that the overall message is what is
most important; even if some of the events
described are inexact, or even false, the truth is that
thousands of people died within her community,
and, as she says on the book’s first page, her
testimony reflects the experience of Guatemala’s
indigenous people.
The CIA World Factbook obliquely refers to the enormous
suffering that characterized Guatemala’s history during the
years following the 1954 military coup until the late 1990s,
stating: “During the second half of the twentieth century, it
experienced a variety of military and civilian governments,
as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996, the government
signed a peace agreement formally ending the conflict,
which had left more than 100,000 people dead and had
created some 1 million refugees.” (CIA World Factbook).
President Bill Clinton traveled to Guatemala in March
1999 to address a meeting of leaders from many sectors of
Guatemalan society, including indigenous leaders, women,
government officials, and representatives of the truth
commission, and spoke far more directly. In one of the
more remarkable moves by a US president, Clinton “on the
third day of his Central America trip, apologized for US
support of Right-wing governments in Guatemala that
killed tens of thousands of rebels and Mayan Indians in
that nation’s 36-year civil war.” After delivering his
574apology, the President called for “reconciliation”
throughout Central America.5
The Evangelical Alternative
With the defeat of the liberation movements in Nicaragua
and El Salvador, Latin Americans, especially in Central
American countries that had been wracked by civil war,
began to turn away from Christian radicalism and
liberation theology. Instead, a part of the world that for
over 500 years had been considered synonymous with
Catholicism was fast becoming a Protestant stronghold.
Moreover, it was precisely in the areas where liberation
theology had blossomed that Evangelical and Pentecostal
Christianity also flourished. Pentecostalism is a form of
Protestantism that relies on baptism, speaking in tongues,
demonstrative acceptance of the Holy Spirit, and
emotional ritual. At the beginning of the 1980s, when
liberation theology was at its peak, there were an estimated
18.6 million Evangelicals in Latin America; a little over a
decade later there were approximately 60 million and a
reported 8,000 Latin American converts daily, according to
the Latin American Catholic Bishops Conference. By 2005
Guatemala was already close to losing its Catholic
majority, with more Protestants than any other
Spanish-speaking country. In Brazil and Nicaragua,
Protestants and members of African and indigenous
religions outnumber Catholics; elsewhere in Latin America
one in five people now identify themselves as Protestants.
Why has this form of Protestant Christianity grown so
rapidly in Latin America? First, it might be argued that the
emotionally charged Protestantism that has taken hold in
575Latin America has built on the strength of liberation
theology, whose popularity had preceded it. The Christian
Base Communities that were the foundation of liberation
theology brought people together around the pursuit of
social justice and linked in a common cause. Achieving
these goals, however, was more difficult, especially as
massive social inequalities refused to disappear and
poverty remained intractable. Obtaining democratic rights
proved to be a more daunting task than uniting in prayer –
and was certainly more dangerous. Secondly, if traditional
Catholicism was hierarchical and distant, liberation
theology, with its reliance on socialist realism, was highly
rational. The emphasis on demanding rights and defeating
poverty in the world today, rather than waiting for
salvation in the next life, was ultimately discouraging,
since in the free market, neoliberal world of the 1990s,
poverty only increased. Constant entreaties from religious
workers for people to dedicate their lives to economic
improvements that never materialized grew demoralizing.
Thirdly, Evangelicals, especially the raucous Pentecostals,
emphasize emotion in the form of communal worship,
giving congregants an experience with the divine through
spiritual ecstasy. Pentecostalism filled a gap and satisfied
people’s spiritual cravings. By contrast liberation
theologians disparaged such things as processions, prayers
to patron saints, the fanatical veneration of Mary, and other
popular forms of piety as “non-transformative,”
displeasing many of the devout who thrived on the uplift
from such rituals.
Finally, Pentecostalism in Latin America, as everywhere,
has relied on aggressive use of the media. Worshippers
come together in huge arenas; televised religious services
576boast celebrity evangelists who claim to channel God’s
power to heal the disabled, cure the sick, bring peace and
happiness to the afflicted. Televised services allow
congregants to feel a part of a huge mass of people, while
watching or listening in their own living rooms or at local
storefront churches. Preachers travel to remote villages of
rural Latin America to hold revivals similar to the
nineteenth-century tent meetings of the “Second Great
Awakening” and other eras of intense spiritual revivalism
in the US and elsewhere. Hence, the “organized
togetherness” of the CEBs laid the foundation for the
emergence of Protestant meeting halls. Evangelicals and
Pentecostals took root on the edges, and then occupied the
center, of communities that came together in hopes of
transforming society, and in the end it seemed easier to
transform oneself than a brutally hostile society; to find
individual ecstasy than obtain social equality.
Further facilitating the growth of Pentecostal churches is
the issue of inclusiveness. The majority of Pentecostal
ministers in much of Latin America are indigenous, while
women comprise over two-thirds of congregations and
hold positions of leadership. In contrast, traditional
Catholicism has nothing but the most secondary role for
women, and liberation theology was not able to extend the
boundaries much further. Most members of Pentecostal
churches are poor and uneducated; however, many from
the middle and upper classes have begun to attend,
providing an even more appealing phenomenon. Protestant
church services bring together disparate classes, races, and
ethnicities, and, unlike the Catholic Church in Latin
America, ministers too are often from the lower class;
some are women, others people of color. Relying mainly
577on trained male priests, the Catholic Church cannot
compete.
Relations between the Evangelicals and Latin American
political parties have not followed a consistent pattern. In
both Guatemala and Colombia Evangelical political parties
have been formed, and Guatemala had a Pentecostal leader
in 1982, General Efrain Ríos Montt (b. 1926). Ríos Montt
was a military dictator and thus his political power did not
represent a mass base for electing a Pentecostal, although
in general Evangelicals and Pentecostals tended to be
hostile toward guerrilla forces. Amnesty International
estimated that over 10,000 indigenous Guatemalans and
peasant farmers were killed from March to July 1982, and
that 100,000 rural villagers were forced to flee their homes
during Ríos Montt’s rule. He was such a brutal dictator
that some Evangelicals concluded that nothing was to be
gained by mixing religion and politics. Tying a political
party, or a leader’s identity, to his religious affiliation
might do more to undermine the spread of Protestantism
than increase it.
In the early days of the evangelical movement in Latin
America, some observers saw the embrace of
Protestantism and rejection of Catholic radicalism as a
conservative victory. This, however, is not necessarily the
case. At the very time that Protestantism has spread and
liberation theology declined, many countries have elected
leftist and socialist presidents, or have a majority of leftists
in their representative assemblies. What this has meant in
terms of Protestant votes is therefore inconclusive.
Colombia: The Longest War
578The wars in Central America largely captured the most
media attention in the latter decades of the twentieth
century; however, it is the ongoing conflict in Colombia
that has resulted in the most casualties, has been the most
costly, and has presented the most intractable outcome. In
1953 La Violencia had reached a temporary halt with the
formation of the National Front, through an agreement
between the dominant Liberal and Conservative parties.
However, the violence could not really be stopped because
so many of the competing groups and factions were left
outside the ruling coalition. Thus internecine warfare, in an
even more uncontrolled manner, commenced anew. Since
1953, Colombia’s history has continued to be marked by
guerrilla warfare, brutal military repression, and numerous
attempts by workers, trade unionists, and community and
civic organizations to forge a civil society. The United
States government’s campaign over the last few decades to
halt coca production has become another source of
violence, pitting guerrilla groups against extremely
well-armed military and paramilitary forces, with innocent
civilians caught in between.
Observers have argued that the thousands of lives lost
during military counterinsurgency campaigns might have
been avoided if both guerrillas and narcotraficantes (drug
traffickers) had been left to cultivate their respective crops
in designated areas. The guerrillas grow coca to sell on the
market, while ostensibly prohibiting its use in the areas
they control. Narcotraficantes follow much the same
course, since excessive consumption of cocaine both cuts
into profits and results in a debilitated workforce. The
main interference in this arrangement has come from the
national government, whose income over the past 20 years
579has become increasingly dependent on foreign aid. As the
chief drug supplier to the US market, Colombia has been
on the receiving end of large amounts of capital and
military hardware, intended to curb the flow of drugs to
markets in the US and Europe. Beginning in the 1990s,
President Andrés Pastrana (b. 1954) proposed during a trip
to Washington that coca and opium poppy production
could only be curbed if his country received massive
economic development aid, including loans and grants to
small farmers so that they could end coca production and
raise legitimate crops. President Bill Clinton responded by
offering to expand trade, beef up funding for oversight of
human rights, and press hard for extensive peace
negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucinaria de Colombia,
FARC), the communist-inspired guerrilla movement that
has been at war with the government since the 1960s. In
the end, the US handed over $560 million in military
assistance alone to fight the guerrillas, who were more
often than not conflated with the narcotraficantes, forming
the foundation for what came to be known as “Plan
Colombia: A Plan for Peace, Prosperity and the
Strengthening of the State.” Plan Colombia quickly
morphed into a $600 million scheme to fund military
operations against insurgents. Even before September 11,
2001 Colombia ranked third, behind Israel and Egypt, as
the largest recipient of US military assistance. Despite the
costly Plan, now a part of Homeland Security, there is no
indication that the flow of drugs into the US has lessened.
The Plan offers no strategy for curbing moneylaundering
operations in the US, the Caribbean, and Colombia, nor
does it include measures to stop a fairly steady demand for
illegal drugs in the US, Canada, and Europe.
580Plan Colombia, and the enormous outlays in military
funding it entails, has undermined and distorted
Colombia’s national priorities. With very little money for
social services and few job opportunities besides the huge
government bureaucracy, some textile, coffee, and other
industries – and of course growing, processing, and selling
coca – the situation of the average Colombian has become
extremely precarious. During the last decade thousands of
Colombians, many of them highly skilled and well
educated, left the country to swell the ranks of immigrant
communities in Florida, New York, and California. The
exact number of Colombians who have migrated to the
United States is not known for sure, but the US census
bureau estimated that 150,000 were living in the country
illegally in 2000. In her book From Ellis Island to JFK:
New York’s Two Great Waves of Immigration,
anthropologist Nancy Foner describes the peopling of vast
sections of the borough of Queens in New York City by
successive waves of Colombians, a pattern that has been
duplicated in other major North American cities.
The War on Drugs in Latin America
Despite the large quantities of cocaine that enter North
America each year, the US military typically has limited
its intervention to high-profile campaigns to apprehend
known Latin American drug dealers, such as the arrest of
Manuel Noriega in Panama in 1989 and the 1993 death of
Pablo Escobar in Medellín, Colombia.
Manuel Noriega
581The most surprising drug lord interdiction was the arrest of
General Manuel Noriega (b. 1936) following the invasion
of Panama in December 1989. What started as an
indictment on drug trafficking and money laundering by
the district attorney’s office in South Florida turned into a
major military action involving thousands of US troops,
carried out under the lofty code name “Operation Just
Cause.” The consummate opportunist, Noriega had at one
point facilitated arms shipments from Cuba to the
Sandinistas in neighboring Nicaragua while working as a
paid informant for the CIA. Noriega was one of the US
intelligence service’s longest-standing operatives in Latin
America. He first began providing information to the US
in the late 1950s when studying at a military academy in
Peru. By the mid-1960s he was a full-fledged informant.
For his work in helping Panamanian president Omar
Torrijos rig an election against a popular opponent,
Noriega was promoted from transit police chief to
commander of the Panamanian Defense Force. According
to his many letters of commendation from the CIA,
Noriega was one of the best intelligence informants in the
hemisphere, maintaining files on every major figure up and
down the continent, including one on the sexual activities
of his boss, Torrijos.
As early as the 1970s it was clear that Noriega was heavily
involved with drug trafficking. According to the records of
the US Senate Intelligence Committee, an official with the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reported to John E.
Ingersoll, Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, in 1972 that Noriega’s drug dealing was
so extensive that the agency considered having him
assassinated, but then decided against it. In 1976, when
582George H. W. Bush was director of the CIA, electronic
eavesdropping equipment showed that Noriega was spying
on Cuba for the CIA while also providing his Cuban
intelligence associates with a list of every telephone
number US intelligence agents were monitoring. Even
after Washington learned of Noriega’s work as a double
agent, he continued on the CIA payroll. Furthermore, the
Carter Administration played down Noriega’s drug
connections and dubious role in espionage as part of its
effort to win ratification of the Panama Canal treaty.
Following the death of Omar Torrijos (1929–81) under
mysterious circumstances in an airplane crash, Noriega
became president of Panama, and an even closer ally of the
US. So long as Noriega was supporting the Reagan
Administration war against the Sandinistas, his
drug-dealing activities were overlooked. As the
Iran-Contra files revealed, the Panamanian president
earned around $10 million for his aid to Oliver North, who
played the pivotal role in setting up clandestine operations
in support of the Contra war against the Nicaraguan
government. Documents reveal that Noriega even offered
– and North accepted but was then overruled by his boss,
National Security Advisor John Poindexter – to have the
entire Sandinista leadership assassinated. According to the
Senate Investigation Committee on the Iran-Contra affair
in 1988, CIA Director William Casey met repeatedly with
Noriega but refused to warn the latter to end his drug
dealing because Casey considered the Panamanian too
valuable an ally in the war against the Sandinistas.
That changed in December 1989 when various government
agencies, including the DEA, determined that Noriega had
583outlived his usefulness. With the Canal treaty set to expire
in 1999 and the canal’s maintenance turned over to
Panama, the US wanted a more reliable president and a
restructured Panamanian Defense Force on the ground.
President George H. W. Bush sent several thousand troops
into Panama, in a military action that cost the lives of 23
US soldiers and as many as 3,000 Panamanians. After
several days of standoff against Noriega, who took refuge
in the Papal Nunciature (the Vatican Embassy), he was
eventually forced out after days of psychological “torture,”
including bombarding the compound with loud heavy
metal rock music, especially Van Halen’s “Panama” and
tapes of the Howard Stern radio show. After his surrender,
Noriega was brought to trial in Florida, where he was
charged with multiple counts of drug trafficking and
money laundering, and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
There are several important features to this sorry tale, not
least of which is that drug interdiction in Latin America is
very much tied up with politics. So long as the relationship
of necessity, not admiration, served its purpose, dictators
such as Noriega basked in the glow of Washington’s
largesse. When the usefulness of these disreputable
sycophants ran out, for whatever reason, their status was
transformed from best friend to worst enemy; their crimes
were exposed, and they were assassinated or jailed.
Affidavits proved that General Noriega earned a salary of
$110,000 a year when George H. W. Bush was director of
the CIA, but a few years later, under the Bush presidency,
he was apprehended, tried, and jailed for crimes that had
been apparent to everyone for years. The real losers were
the ordinary citizens of Panama. Forced to endure the
brutality of a drug-running dictator when he was protected
584by the US, they then found their country invaded, their
houses bombed, and thousands killed when the dictator fell
out of favor. Finally, Noriega was little more than a
stand-in for the cocaine operations centered further south,
in Colombia.
Pablo Escobar: The cocaine “Robin Hood”
The most notorious drug baron of the 1980s was Pablo
Escobar (1949–93), a controversial head of the Medellín
cartel who was listed in the 1989 Forbes magazine as the
seventh richest man in the world, taking in an estimated
$30 billion annually. Reputedly one of the most brutal and
daring of the Colombian narcotraficantes, with a network
of refining, buying, and selling cocaine that stretched from
Bolivia and Peru, through Colombia and from there to
entrepôts abroad, Escobar controlled 80 percent of the
cocaine market by the end of the 1980s. Despite his
notoriety, Escobar was something of a hero to the poor of
Medellín, where his protection from capture was based on
the willingness of the local populace to warn him of any
encroaching enemies. He built football stadiums in poor
neighborhoods, organized sports teams, gave away food,
built houses, and personally distributed money. He was
especially popular with the local Catholic clergy because
he financed the construction of many churches throughout
the city. While Escobar cultivated his Robin Hood image
among the people of Medellín, he was making enemies
among rival drug cartels and the Colombian government.
In 1993 a special force of US Navy Seals (at that time
called Delta Force) and a crack Colombian military unit
invaded the drug baron’s compound, killed Escobar, and
destroyed his cartel. Nevertheless, the drug trade did not
585end with Escobar’s death, nor did it seriously interrupt the
flow of narcotics abroad since there were other drug
barons waiting to step into the void. As then Colombian
President Andrés Pastrana said in 2000 on the television
program 60 Minutes, “even if we win in Colombia, there
will always be another country to supply the US with
drugs, as long as the demand for them remains.”6
Currently that country is Mexico. Major drug-running
operations (originating in Colombia for the most part) have
moved into Mexico full force, turning the Texas-Mexico
border into a place of constant violent drug wars.
Journalist Alma Guillermoprieto reported in a New Yorker
article in late 2008 that sources in Mexico claim that more
than 40 years after a string of “drug-war initiatives – as
much as thirty percent of Mexico’s arable land is suspected
of being under cultivation for clandestine crops, drug
violence in Sinaloa has taken a quantitatively different
turn, and the Sinaloa traffickers have generated entire
dynasties of criminals who are at war in nearly every one
of Mexico’s thirty-one states, as well as Mexico City.”7
In
2009 President Barack Obama acknowledged that as the
world’s number one consumer of illegal drugs, primary
source of illegal weapons, and main locale for drug money
laundering, the US shares responsibility for Mexico’s drug
wars.
Conclusion
The conflicts in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s
were like a stage play of the last gasp of the Cold War. As
tiny, impoverished nations tried to assert their own
national identity, which was in some cases influenced by
586Marxist socialism and communism, and at other times by
progressive Catholicism, and pro-capitalist nationalist
ideologies, their progress crashed head-on into the brick
wall of US national interests. These were, as defined by
the White House, entirely opposite from the goals of the
Central American liberation movements. A decade later it
would not have mattered so much and these conflicts
might have been resolved in a far less brutal and violent
way, but it is very hard to say for sure.
An intransigent ruling class in El Salvador, Guatemala,
and Nicaragua left very little space for experimentation
with alternative forms of national liberation. Colombia and
Mexico have presented their own circumstances, including
an ongoing civil war among factions of the FARC and the
narcotraficantes in Colombia, and massive US monetary
assistance and seemingly futile drug interdiction efforts in
both countries. Finally, the decades of conflict brought to
the foreground divisions that have been in existence since
the early days of the European invasion 500 years before:
entrenched racism that prevented indigenous people from
full participation in civil society; a Catholic hierarchy and
working clergy at odds with each other over what the true
mission of the Church should be; and a long list of
disagreements over the role of women, the reasons the
poor are poor, and the responsibility of the state to
alleviate poverty. In every case discussed in this chapter
the revolutionary leadership was young, their idealism led
to mistakes, but, unfortunately, they were allowed no
leeway to make mistakes and correct them. The process of
sovereign state building shipwrecked on the rocks of the
Cold War. In the next, and final, chapter, we take up the
changing social and political conditions in Latin America
587since the end of the competition between the two
superpowers and examine the new lines of demarcation
and contention.
58814
The Americas in the Twenty-first Century
The twenty-first century promised to be a new chapter in
Latin America. Neoliberalism, a program calling for
maximum wage controls, dismantling of state-owned
industries, and promotion of free trade, became the
watchword of Latin America. In 1990 the defeat of the
Sandinistas in the Nicaraguan elections, occurring
simultaneously with the demise of Soviet and Eastern
European communism and the stalemate in the war in El
Salvador that led to a negotiated settlement, signaled a
profound alteration in the old Cold War antagonisms. By
century’s end, the United States stood alone, no longer
contending with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as
one of two superpowers. Not only did Cuba lose over 75
percent of its financial and trade support and enter a
“special period” of extreme austerity and deprivation, but
it was no longer a safe haven for Latin American
revolutionaries.
Although the Soviet Union had provided very little direct
aid to Latin America’s revolutionary struggles (apart from
aid and arms funneled through Cuba), it had served as a
competing voice at the UN and other world arenas, a tactic
that had generally stayed the hand of direct US military
aggression around the world. Whereas the left had not
greeted Soviet aggression abroad with great approval, it
had more often remained silent. Only a few egregious
examples elicited disapproval, such as the invasion of
Prague in 1968, mid-1970s support for Ethiopia against the
589Eritrean People’s Liberation Front in Africa, and, most
decidedly, the military occupation of Afghanistan, a
debacle that bore an eerie similarity to US interventions in
Latin America and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.
However, the rapid demise of Soviet communism shocked
many leftists. When the USSR collapsed, many socialists
were appalled to learn the degree of exploitation,
corruption, environmental destruction, and inequality the
Soviet system had tolerated internally.
The Washington Consensus
In the final decades of the twentieth century Washington
and its surrogate agencies in the World Bank, IMF, the
Inter-American Development Bank, and a host of similar
financial powerhouses were free to exert enormous
influence on the future course of Latin American nations.
As if to drive home the point, the dramatic change in the
balance of power was apparent in the term used
interchangeably with “neoliberalism” in Latin America:
the “Washington Consensus.” As the revolutionary phase
in Central America ended, so too did the military
dictatorships that had held sway from one end of the
continent to the other. The national security states in
Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Peru crumbled and
left-leaning populist republics took their place. The
political and economic prospects facing many Latin
American nations at the start of the new millennium were
in stark contrast to the strife of the 1970s, when almost
every country, except for Colombia, Mexico, and
Venezuela, was under military rule – and the three
exceptions were hardly beacons of democracy. The current
group of left-populist and moderate socialist governments
590that have come to power through the ballot box have
accommodated to free-market demands, eschewed the
Cuban model, and developed particular and varied
relationships with international creditors. Above all, Latin
America’s future is tied closely to that of other countries in
the hemisphere, since after 500 years the Americas are
increasingly interdependent politically, economically, and
culturally.
Mexico, the country most closely linked to the United
States, may find itself in the most daunting position, as the
economic downturn in the capital of finance deepens.
Politically Mexico is stable, but lacks the reform-oriented
government found in other parts of Latin America. In the
late 1980s a center-left coalition, the Democratic National
Front (FND), formed a reformist current in the PRI
(Partido Revolucionario Institutional) to challenge the
standard political practice of the outgoing faction
appointing the incoming candidate – tantamount to
choosing the next president. The FND backed Cuauhtémoc
Cárdenas (b. 1934), son of former President Lázaro
Cárdenas (president 1934–40), but the young Cárdenas had
the candidacy stolen from him in 1988 when the traditional
faction backed Carlos Salinas de Gortari (b. 1948), who
went on to win the election. The center-left forces then
broke off to form the Party of the Democratic Revolution
(PRD, Partido Revolucionario Democratico), and under
Cárdenas’s leadership ran against the PRI in elections
throughout the country, with considerable success on the
local level. However, in 2000 it was a challenger from the
right, Vicente Fox (b. 1942) of the National Action Party
(PAN) that finally unseated the PRI. When the PAN won
again in 2006, after a torturously prolonged and disputed
591election in which Felipe Calderón (b. 1962) ultimately was
declared the victor, the PRI was reduced to a shadow of its
former self. Since the 2006 election, the PAN has emerged
as Mexico’s strongest party, controlling most seats in
Congress as well as the executive. Later in this chapter we
examine current political trends in Mexico in more detail.
Brazil and the Workers’ Alternative
Brazil’s current political and economic successes and
failures play out on a scale unequaled in the rest of the
Latin America. With its large population, industrial base,
varied climate and terrain, and extreme income
inequalities, Brazil faces one of the largest challenges in
the hemisphere. Under the left-leaning Workers’ Party
(PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores), neoliberalism has been,
rhetorically at least, on the defensive. Luíz Inácio “Lula”
da Silva had promised a dramatic change in social
priorities – health care, educational reform, a living wage,
help for the poor – when he was elected in 2002 and
re-elected in 2006, but progress has been slow. If Lula’s
personal history is inspirational, his presidency has been
pragmatic.
Lula emerged as a key trade union leader in the industrial
belt around São Paulo in the late 1970s. The trade union
movement developed into a formidable force opposed to
the military government and spearheaded the return to
democracy and presidential elections in 1989. At the head
of the Workers’ Party ticket, Lula ran in 1989 and lost to
the corrupt Fernando Collor de Mello, a photogenic former
karate champion and member of a wealthy family in the
small, far-north state of Alagoas. With the help of Roberto
592Marinho, the conservative head of Brazil’s huge O Globo
media empire, Collor’s laissez-faire economic program
defeated Lula’s left-leaning social democratic platform.
Collor’s “economic shock plan,” in step with the mandates
of international capital, called for selling off
state-controlled enterprises to the private sector (mainly to
those enjoying political or personal connections to the
president) and instigating a stringent austerity program to
arrest inflation. Despite monitoring by international
lenders, the economy span out of control, matched only by
the corruption scandal that soon enveloped the Collor
administration. Much to the disappointment of Brazil’s
electorate, the first democratically elected presidency in
nearly 30 years began to unravel after only two years in
office, ending in Collor’s impeachment and resignation in
December 1992.
The demise of the Collor administration bore all the
markings of a telenovela, beginning with his brother Pedro
Collor’s public exposure of Fernando’s cocaine habit and
moving on to revelations of an embezzlement/kickback
scheme that funneled money into a host of private bank
accounts benefiting family members, cabinet ministers,
and political allies. The newly uncensored press reveled in
stories of First Lady Rosane Collor’s plastic surgery,
$20,000-a-month clothing allowance, and Parisian
shopping sprees, as well as photos of elaborate house
renovations – all at tax payers’ expense. Nonetheless,
Brazilians could be proud that their newly revived justice
system worked, in some ways more efficiently than that of
the United States. Collor received no presidential pardon –
unlike Richard Nixon in 1974 – and no immunity from
prosecution.
593Vice-President Itamar Franco served out the rest of
Collor’s term. He appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso
(b. 1931), a former Marxist sociology professor from the
University of São Paulo, to serve in the cabinet as Finance
Minister. Ushering in a new currency, the real, and
launching an austerity program, Cardoso’s term as head of
finance, and subsequent two terms as president, are seen as
Brazil’s insertion into the Washington Consensus model.
Leaving behind his leftist roots, Cardoso carved out a
center-right position by aligning his own Brazilian Social
Democratic Party (PSDB, Partido da Social Democracia
Brasileira) with the more rightist Liberal Front Party (PFL,
Partido do Frente Liberal), in opposition to Lula’s
Workers’ Party. While the government followed the
dictates of international lenders and policymakers,
progressive groups organized around cultural and social
issues, and the trade unions kept up a steady drumbeat of
demand for economic improvements. The years from 1994
until 2002 were characterized by lively debate, innovation,
intense cultural and political activism, and no small
measure of conflict. Some have seen it as the apex of the
ideological and political influence of the Workers’ Party,
and a time when activist groups such as the Landless
Workers Movement (MST, Movimento dos Trabalhadores
Rurais sem Terra), those involved in grass-roots
organizing for racial and gender equality, environmental
reforms, social and political rights for workers, the poor,
and the disenfranchised, were at their zenith. The intense
political mobilization, while the PT was building its base
and vying for power, made the last decade of the twentieth
century one of Brazil’s most exciting and hopeful.
The Workers’ Party in Power
594After running unsuccessfully for president in 1994 and
1998, Lula won in 2002 on a program that, critics claimed,
departed from the PT social agenda, considerably
softening the working class’s longstanding denunciation of
Cardoso’s neoliberal economic policies. Instead of a
confrontation with the IMF and World Bank, Brazil under
Lula has restructured its payments, staved off creditors,
and attempted, haltingly, to reduce widespread and
endemic poverty, crime, and hunger. In stark contrast to
the years in which he climbed to fame denouncing first the
subservience of the military governments, and then
Cardoso, to international creditors, Lula reversed his
stance and accepted the core of the neoliberal agenda: debt
repayment based on “fiscal responsibility” and austerity,
coupled with scaled-back anti-poverty programs, a freeze
on wages, and postponement of environmental protections.
Hammered by charges of political corruption in the
innermost circle of the PT, a muchweakened Lula won
re-election in a run-off in 2006. The analysis of that
victory reveals the fundamental contradictions facing
anyone attempting to enact change in a country as vast and
as plagued by centuries of inequality and corruption as
Brazil. Lula won in 20 out of 27 states, carrying virtually
all of the poorest districts of the North, and losing or
splitting in most of the prosperous South. In fact, the
smaller and the poorer the district, the better Lula did. Part
of his support was based on his core supporters’ loyalty to
the poor boy from an impoverished background who rose
through the ranks of the working class. Another part was
dismissal of the validity of corruption charges (or
resignation to the belief that politics is always corrupt).
But a major share of his victory rested on the electorate’s
595fear of the alternative. If Lula, as many claimed, had failed
to resist vigorously the neoliberal agenda, Geraldo
Alckmin, the businessman who ran against him, promised
to embrace the Washington Consensus and turn back some
of the PT’s major successes: an increase in the minimum
wage, monetary payments to over 11 million families
through the Bolsa Familia Program, over 200,000
scholarships to private universities for low-income
students, reduced taxes on food and other essentials, and
an increase in family incomes, sometimes by as much as
40 percent. It was not the workers’ paradise the PT had
promised, but it was better than the alternative.
Brazil is a country faced with enormous challenges on a
vast scale. Centuries of poor land use and failure to
implement the agrarian reforms required to sustain small
producers in the countryside have resulted in a continual
exodus from rural to urban areas. Brazil now boasts some
of the largest cities in the world: São Paulo’s metropolitan
region has 20 million inhabitants, including large sections
that are essentially ungovernable. A country of nearly 200
million people, 20 percent of whom are illiterate, with an
infant mortality rate more than twice that of the US and
widespread unemployment, Brazil’s potential as an
industrial and agricultural giant has been consistently
undermined by poverty and its consequences, especially
drug use, crime, and massive official corruption. While
Brazil could out-produce every other nation in Latin
America and has enormous resources in land, minerals, a
recently discovered oil reserve, and a huge workforce,
future economic health depends on years of prolonged
growth, as well as leaders who can and will steadfastly
root out corruption and distribute the benefits to the
596population at large. With 175 million acres of arable land,
even without clearing the Amazon rainforest, Brazil hopes
to double its share of exports, primarily to China, but also
to India and other areas. Although the United States
out-produces Brazil in soybeans, the latter has recently
emerged as the largest exporter, sending 11 million tons of
beans to China alone.
The rising demand for food exports – mainly soybeans,
which are one of Brazil’s key export commodities and one
for which there is insatiable demand in China – is
encountering competition for land use from sugarcane
destined for ethanol production. Brazilian producers are
severely handicapped by the nation’s primitive system of
roads, railroads, and infrastructure necessary for moving
goods from the interior of the country to ports. Shipping
costs are four times those in the US. Clearly the many
years of neglect under military governments – especially in
relation to infrastructure, and developing a cadre of
managers and technical and service sector employees – has
hindered Brazil’s ability to accrue the revenue it should
from international sales. The financial crisis in late 2008
has affected the ease with which Brazil has been able to
maintain strong export markets. Depending on the extent
to which the crisis will affect credit supplies (and credit is
essential for agricultural production), Brazil may face
shortfalls in supplying its external market, or in finding
buyers for crops already in the ground. Either scenario
could have a disastrous ripple effect in other sectors of
Brazil’s developing economy.
Bolivia: Twenty-first-century Indigenismo
597As left-leaning populist governments have become more
the rule than the exception, a different sort of struggle has
emerged among and between them. For example, President
Evo Morales of Bolivia has faced conflict with
neighboring Brazil and Argentina, both headed by leftist
governments sympathetic to Bolivia’s progressive agenda.
However, because a large share of Bolivia’s natural gas
reserves were in the hands of Brazil’s state-owned
company Petrobrás, Morales’ nationalization plans came
into direct conflict with Brazil. Similarly, Argentina feared
increased prices for Bolivian natural gas, since Morales
hinted that increased revenues from gas sales are needed to
implement the domestic reform platform on which he was
elected. Higher prices would anger Argentine consumers,
the main market for Bolivia’s natural gas, and thus
possibly undermine the popularity of President Cristina
Kirchner (b. 1953), herself one of Morales’ prime backers.
To the west, President Morales seems interested in
improving relations with Chile. He attended the
inauguration of Michelle Bachelet, and she was present at
Morales’ inaugural, signaling a thaw in the chilly
diplomatic relations that have divided their nations for
more than a century, since Chile cut off Bolivia’s access to
the sea after the latter’s defeat in the War of the Pacific.
These socialist governments will need to settle their
longstanding disputes and reach accords that they can sell
to their respective constituencies.
Like Brazil and other South American countries, Bolivia
has begun forging international agreements with partners
outside the hemisphere. In September 2006 Jindal Steel
and Power of India contracted with the Bolivian
government to mine one of the world’s largest veins of
598untapped iron deposits. Meanwhile, the Australian
Republic Gold Company invested $26 million in the
Amayapampa mine in the high Andes, beginning
production in 2008. Investment from South Asian and
Australian firms invokes less suspicion and hostility than
that of the US or powerful neighboring countries with a
history of dominating the landlocked Andean country, but
the fact remains that Bolivia is still reliant on infusions of
external capital. This is of particular importance given that
Morales faces domestic discontent. Although 64 percent of
the population lives below the poverty line, Bolivia is
nonetheless unevenly poor. Natural gas reserves and the
best agricultural land is concentrated in the more
prosperous eastern region, presenting the government with
the task of holding onto the loyalty of all regions, while
maintaining an equitable balance of resources across the
country. Tension came to a head in a battle over adopting a
new constitution in December 2007. The resourcerich
Santa Cruz area in the east refused to accept new
constitutional protections for indigenous groups,
languages, and election procedures. More importantly, the
more prosperous eastern regions objected to the use of gas
and oil revenues to finance improvements in the standard
of living for the most impoverished areas where
indigenous people predominate. Resolving the disputes
and decisions facing Morales – and other leftist and
progressive leaders – will require untangling longstanding
tensions among like-minded Latin American nations,
forging cooperative agreements to take the place of
traditional dependency on foreign investment, and building
national unity across deeply divided racial, ethnic, and
regional lines.
599Venezuela and Hugo Chávez
Looming over the continent, and liable to play an active
role in whatever course Latin American nations pursue, is
the figure of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez (b. 1954)
and, more importantly, the oil he controls – the
fifth-largest oil reserve in the world and one of the most
important sources of heavy crude. Chávez, a former army
paratrooper, came to power in 1998 in a country which,
unlike others in the hemisphere, had enjoyed an unbroken
period of representative government since 1958, despite
the domination of two, largely corrupt, political parties.
Very little of the nation’s wealth from oil revenues had
benefited the bulk of Venezuelans: witness the fact that
from 1970 to 1998 per capita income fell by 35 percent,
one of the sharpest, prolonged declines in the world.
Promising “revolutionary” social policies and realization
of nineteenth-century liberator Simon Bolívar’s dream of
independent democratic republics throughout South
America, Chávez launched his “Bolivarian Revolution”
aimed at spreading the nation’s wealth to the majority of
poor residents. A career military officer, Chávez was a
founder of the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement, a group
of army officers and cadets who came together after two
failed military coups – one in February and another in
November 1992 – against then President Carlos Andrés
Pérez (b. 1922). Jailed for conspiracy and amnestied after
two years in prison, Chávez emerged with even greater
strength to back his campaign for political office and
complete the transition from army officer to civilian
politician. Winning the presidency in 1998 on a platform
that promised relief for the millions of Venezuela’s poor,
Chávez has managed in the years since to survive a recall,
600a failed coup, and spates of dramatic declines in popularity
(Figure 14.1).
Chávez’s brash, sometimes uncouth, style combined with
his unabashed admiration for Fidel Castro and the political
system in place in Cuba, on the one hand, and his repeated
denunciation of the Washington Consensus, on the other,
have garnered him both begrudging admiration and
outright hostility from many of his neighbors. Supported
by Bolivia’s Morales, Argentina’s Kirchners (Nestor (b.
1950) and Cristina), Ecuador’s Rafael Correa (b. 1963),
and, more tepidly, by Lula in Brazil, Chávez has been able
to keep the open hostility of the USA at bay, and even
dramatically roll back attempts to oust him from power.
Figure 14.1 US Navy Commander Officer Robert S.

Hugo Chávez during a tour of the USS Yorktown in
Curação Harbor, Netherlands Antilles in 2002. The ship
was a part of Unitas (Unity), the largest multinational
naval exercise conducted by the US. Caribbean, Central,
and South American naval forces gathered with the focus
on building a hemispheric coalition for mutual defense and
cooperation. This photo was shot a month before the
abortive coup against Chávez, which the US supported.
Despite periodic tension between leaders of the US and
Venezuela, the two countries maintain commercial and
diplomatic ties. (Martin Maddock, USN, photo)
601The changed state of Latin America’s relationship with
Washington, despite the strength of the neoliberal agenda,
was no more evident than in April 2002. On April 11,
conservative forces drew on support from a wing of the
military discontented with Chávez to launch a coup d’état.
Chávez was detained at a military base outside Caracas,
while the rebellious military, in consultation with powerful
figures in the Venezuela elite and media conglomerates,
installed Pedro Carmona (b. 1941) as Venezuela’s interim
president. A former president of Fedecamaras – an
organization representing the heads of the country’s
banking, agricultural, commercial, and oil interests, a kind
of Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce – Carmona
represents the business community that had vehemently
opposed Chávez’s social reforms. Carmona immediately
annulled the reform agenda, disbanded the National
Assembly and the judiciary, and declared marshal law.
Despite the blatantly undemocratic nature of the coup and
removal of an elected president from office in a
602neighboring country, the Bush Administration immediately
recognized the new government, a tactic that subsequently
proved embarrassing. In a stark departure from the Cold
War era, the twentyfirst century found the US standing
alone – not only unable to strong-arm support for its
position from the rest of Latin America’s leaders, but the
object of chastisement and ridicule in the media and
among political parties throughout the region, and a
scolding from the OAS. Meanwhile, the poorest strata of
society poured into the streets of Caracas and other cities,
demonstrating their support for Chávez and their
unwillingness to accept Carmona as president. In the wake
of widespread demonstrations and looting of shops in
wealthy shopping districts, and facing a popular uprising
supported by a majority of the armed forces, the elite and
the media it controlled retreated. Chávez’s military
supporters stormed the presidential palace and spirited him
back into office on April 13, signaling an end to the
two-day regime change. After failing to oust Chávez at the
ballot box, or through a series of management-led general
strikes of betterpaid petroleum workers and members of
the labor aristocracy, or the military coup, the Venezuelan
elite accepted temporary defeat, but maintain a concerted
opposition stance.
The Bolivarian Mission
The Venezuelan leader’s “Bolivarian Revolution” has
hinged on some successful forays into combating disease,
illiteracy, poverty, and the generally inadequate level of
social services facing the majority of Venezuelans. This
campaign, labeled “the Bolivarian Mission,” has scored
some remarkable improvements in health care,
603accomplished with the generous assistance of Cuban
medical teams. Since 2000 Venezuela has agreed to supply
40 million barrels of oil yearly to energy-deprived Cuba in
exchange for teams of doctors, nurses, and medical
technicians, who have established neighborhood clinics
throughout the country, emulating the practice that proved
so effective in the provision of quality health care to
remote areas of Cuba. Re-elected in 2000 and 2006,
Chávez’s popularity rests squarely with the lower classes
who have benefited from these health initiatives and
similar policies. Venezuela is undoubtedly a country with
widespread inequalities and poverty; however, poverty
rates fell from 42 to 34 percent from 2000 to 2006, still
leaving over 30 percent of the population in this oil-rich
nation below the poverty line.
Although many of Venezuela’s poor would like to see
better results, especially given oil revenues, the masses
have continued to back their president at the polls. In
December 2007 the Venezuelan leader narrowly lost an
attempt to revise the Constitution to allow him to run for
office indefinitely, but also to cut the working week,
legalize same-sex unions, and increase social spending.
Despite accusations that Chávez has attempted to
perpetuate his rule indefinitely, the constitutional reform
was grounded in the electoral process and as such would
not have differed dramatically from other countries, such
as the UK where Margaret Thatcher (b. 1925) was Prime
Minister for 11 years. In fact, one key distinguishing factor
in Venezuela is that Chávez has won repeated elections,
despite US attempts to discredit him as an authoritarian
demagogue. As historian Greg Grandin notes, “I can think
of no other instance where similar attempts to reorder
604political and social relations have been ratified at the ballot
on an ongoing basis.”1 Moreover, the fairness of
Venezuela’s elections, including an unsuccessful recall in
2004 and the constitutional reform of 2007, have been
certified by the Organization of American States, the
Carter Center, and the European Union. The media
continues uncensored, and most of it relentlessly attacks
Chávez, even supporting his overthrow in the failed 2002
military coup, although he nationalized one of the
networks in 2006, a step that has made some supporters
uneasy. Indications that Chávez’s popularity may be
waning surfaced in the November 2008 regional elections.
While parties friendly to Chávez yet maintain the upper
hand in congressional representation, Chávez’s party lost
out to opponents in many areas of the country.
Chávez and “the Pink Tide”
President Chávez has maintained a highly controversial
foreign policy: allegedly siding with the leftist guerrillas in
Colombia; claiming for Venezuela a wide swath of tiny
neighboring Guyana; and repeatedly disparaging the
conservative candidates in elections in Peru and Mexico.
Illustrative of the divisiveness his image invokes was the
response to his performance at the United Nations General
Assembly in late 2006, where in a speech viewed by much
of the world, he compared George W. Bush to the devil.
Newspapers and other media outlets in the US referred to
him as a buffoon at best, while the media in Argentina and
Bolivia laughed out loud and cheered him on; Ecuador’s
Rafael Correa remarked that the comparison was unfair to
the devil. No one, however, doubts the influence he can
wield using Venezuela’s oil supply, and record high oil
605prices, as clout (see Box 14.1). For example, in 2005
Venezuela underwrote Argentina’s loans from other
sources to the tune of $2.4 billion, allowing the Kirchner
government to pay off the IMF, and it has bought over
$300 million in bonds from Ecuador.
Box 14.1 Got milk for oil?
One of the most innovative initiatives of the
Bolivarian Revolution is its pursuit of agreements
with various Latin American and Caribbean
countries to exchange oil for doctors and medical
personnel (Cuba); milk and software technology
(Uruguay); and cattle and medical equipment
(Argentina). In addition oil was sold at preferred
prices (or given outright as charity) to the
Dominican Republic, Haiti – and even the South
Bronx, one of the poorest boroughs of New York
City, populated heavily by Latin Americans. In
addition to the delivery of cheap oil to the Bronx,
parts of Massachusetts and other poor areas,
Chávez offered to send relief to victims of
Hurricane Katrina in lower Louisiana and
Mississippi. The offer, refused by the US
government, mimicked Cuba’s offer of medical
personnel in the immediate aftermath of the
hurricane. More importantly, on March 28, 2006
Chávez sent a message to the Bush Administration
offering to drop oil to $50 a barrel, down from its
then level of $75 a barrel, which would have
606knocked about a dollar off every gallon at the
pump. The White House quickly rejected the offer,
denouncing it as so much grandstanding on the part
of Venezuela’s president. With oil at $40 a barrel
at the end of 2008, Chávez has seen his influence
curtailed.
Complicating Social Ties
Hugo Chávez’s Bolivarian Revolutionary agenda has not
appealed to voters everywhere. In two key elections
moderate-to-conservative candidates defeated left
populists Hugo Chávez had backed. In the first case,
Ollanta Moisés Humala Tasso (b. 1963) ran for the
president of Peru in 2006 on a platform calling for social
reforms and nationalization of mineral resources. A former
lieutenant colonel in the Peruvian army, Humala, like
Chávez, had arisen through the ranks of the armed forces,
and his past was thus clouded by accusations of human
rights violations during the “dirty war” against the Shining
Path and other guerrilla movements during the turbulent
1990s. Running for office under a coalition that included
the Union for Peru (Unión por el Perú) and the Peruvian
Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista Peruana), Humala
emerged from the crowded field after the first round, only
to meet defeat in the second round to former president
Alan García (b. 1949), leader of the Aprista Party (APRA),
who had served as president from 1985 to 1990. Voters
seemed willing to overlook García’s earlier humiliating
drubbing in the wake of a series of economic disasters,
607ineffectual attempts to quell the guerrilla uprising,
corruption, and failed social programs. Several
commentators argued that Humala might have lost some
votes because of suspicions over his human rights record
from his military days. Others contend that Alan García
benefitted from the backlash set off by Chávez’s
enthusiastic endorsement of Humala, which many
Peruvians interpreted as unwelcome meddling in their own
internal affairs.
A second case, marred by even greater acrimony, was the
presidential election in Mexico during the fall of 2006.
Felipe de Jesus Calderón (b. 1962) of the PAN was elected
in a contest so close it is impossible to say whether he
really won the election or not. Calderón took office on
December 1, 2006 when the national election commission
declared him the winner. The opposition PRD screamed
fraud, but either because they had tired of the controversy
or because the majority really believed Calderón the
winner, little was left but the bombast over the outcome.
Similar to Peru, Chávez’s outspoken support for the PRD
candidate rubbed some Mexicans the wrong way, quite
possibly throwing a crucial number of votes to Calderón in
this extremely tight race.
As luck would have it, the rise of Hugo Chávez coincided
with the Bush Administration’s general neglect of Latin
America. With US concerns focused squarely on the
Middle East, wars with Iraq and Afghanistan, and festering
problems in Korea, Latin America was mostly left to its
own devices, a situation that actually might have allowed
for greater autonomy. By the time that George W. Bush
launched a mini-tour of South America in March 2007,
608stopping off in Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and
Guatemala, many diplomats viewed his foreign policy
initiative as too little too late. Commenting on the trip, the
Council on Hemispheric Affairs summed up North–South
relations tersely: “The general distaste for the Bush
administration within Latin America is now a profound
fact of life.” Met throughout Latin America by
demonstrations and media hostility toward the US, Bush
attempted to assuage his critics by signing trade
agreements with Uruguay, entering into a joint ethanol
deal with Brazil, and lending final approval to loan and aid
agreements. No matter what Bush had on offer, Hugo
Chávez had been there first with proposals the US could
not, or did not, match, resulting in a continued unfavorable
view of the US among its Latin American neighbors.
While Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela have
aligned more closely with Chávez, and Mexico, Colombia,
and Peru with generally more favorable ties with
Washington, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay have attempted to
remain aloof from close associations with either camp.
Chile’s Transition to Democracy
After the defeat of General Pinochet in 1990 and the return
to democracy, Chile’s socialist coalition government,
Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia (Coalition of
Parties for Democracy), known as the Concertación, has
embraced a model that critics on the left have seen as more
at peace with neoliberalism and privatization than aimed at
reducing socioeconomic inequalities. The picture is more
complicated. Under Pinochet, Chile was a poster child for
neoliberalism, its economic policy a page out of
conservative economist Milton Friedman’s (1912–2006)
609Capitalism and Freedom. Although Pinochet has been
gone for over a decade, the Concertación has not been able
to dismantle the extensive privatization that took place
under the junta. Defenders of the post-Pinochet
governments argue that the state is committed to ending
poverty, malnutrition, and illiteracy, but it has been
difficult to win over many conservatives in Congress to
such an agenda. Nonetheless, private investment has been
massive, Chile’s copper mines are in the hands of foreign
companies, and public works have not addressed the needs
of poorer people, for example, building superhighways for
automobiles at the expense of expanding public
transportation; erecting luxury, high-rise apartments rather
than housing for the thousands who remain in desperately
poor slums; and facilitating the emergence of private
schools and universities thereby draining funds from the
public education system.
Figure 14.2 Isabel Reveco, a forensic anthropologist,
shows Chilean Judge Juan Guzman the remains of persons

610Chile’s growth, as much as eight percent for several years
and hovering around five to six percent in 2005, has been
based on energetic marketing of agricultural products and
wine. Chile now has extensive bilateral trade agreements
with the US, China, the European Union, MERCOSUR,
South Korea, Japan, and Mexico and is adding more all the
time. The agreements provide large markets for many
varieties of fruits and vegetables that ripen when the
northern hemisphere is in winter. Record-high copper
prices have helped to strengthen the peso and provide
high-paying jobs for a small sector of the workforce, but
unemployment remains a chronic problem in much of the
country. Over the more than two decades of socialist
governments education, health care, environmental
policies, and social services have improved markedly;
however, pressing problems, such as inadequate housing,
611low wages, inequality, and rural malnutrition, have
received less attention.
Chile’s most distinguishing feature in 2007 was its
president, Michelle Bachelet (b. 1951), who assumed
office in 2006, a year when female heads of government
doubled across the globe. Bachelet’s assumption of
political office was seen as paradoxical in a country that is
by most standards strongly Catholic and culturally
conservative. It bears remembering that right-wing women
were at the forefront of the movement that brought down
Salvador Allende’s socialist coalition in 1973, and many
elite women were (and still are) mainstays of the
pro-Catholic, conservative opposition to any form of class,
social, or gender equality.
Nonetheless, Bachelet’s presidency has signaled a
tremendous change. A socialist, atheist, unmarried mother
of three children from different fathers, a former political
prisoner who was tortured in Villa Grimaldi, one of
Chile’s most famous detention centers, and who was exiled
in East Germany, Bachelet is a decidedly new kind of
leader (Figure 14.2). Her very election reflects greater
tolerance of a more radical, feminist agenda on the part of
the electorate, or at least a willingness to consider a more
radical cultural makeup. She has introduced several key
changes, including sex education in schools; free access to
contraception for all girls and women 14 years and older,
with or without parental consent; appointment of many
women to government posts; and other measures that have
sparked the ire of the Catholic hierarchy and the moderate
political majority. As a physician, Bachelet is very
interested in promoting women’s health, and as a feminist
612politician she is demonstrating a willingness to break
through the barriers that have prevented women from
achieving meaningful employment at all levels of society.
As she proclaimed in her first annual address to the
Chilean congress: “I am here as a woman, representing the
defeat of the exclusion to which we were subjected for so
long.”2Nonetheless, Chile was one of only three countries
in Latin America in 2008 that did not allow abortions, even
in the case of rape or when the mother’s life was in danger.
New Social Movements
Michelle Bachelet’s words can be interpreted more
broadly, to include all of those in Latin America who have
been excluded. Bachelet and Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner
have won office because a vital feminist movement has
been organizing to break down traditional gender barriers
that excluded women from positions of authority. Evo
Morales in Bolivia and Lula in Brazil rose through the
ranks of the trade union movement and broad political
coalitions that promoted a progressive agenda: MÁS
(Movimiento al Socialismo) in Bolivia and the PT in
Brazil. In fact, the most promising change on the political
scene today is the rise of activists and social action groups,
many of them transnational, throughout Latin America. In
country after country dictatorships were brought down and
reform-minded leaders won office because of the
grass-roots work of countless mass organizations. These
“new social movements” have spearheaded a multipronged
approach to widening democratic rights throughout Latin
America. With the aid of radical church groups,
progressive and leftist political parties, and the joint efforts
of domestic and international agencies, a new agenda is in
613motion calling for laws to distribute land, promote gender
equality, protect the environment, win rights for workers,
redress centuries of abuse toward indigenous people and
people of color, and further the cause of social justice.
The most controversial move of Chávez’s Bolivarian
Revolution was state-supported land redistribution,
including forceful land occupations by peasants armed
with machetes and firearms, backed by military units.
Although the government claims that peasants who were
paid very low wages on big estates in the past have a right
to occupy idle land, the previous owners, unsurprisingly,
do not agree. More than 160 peasants and eight
landowners have been killed in clashes, usually between
squatters and hired gunmen working for the landowners,
and sometimes escalating into retaliatory attacks against
the owners. The peasants have enjoyed the backing of the
Chávez Administration, as a part of the latter’s efforts to
increase Venezuela’s self-sufficiency in food production.
Toward that end the government has installed thousands of
statefinanced cooperatives on properties previously owned
by cattle ranchers, and, according to the government, little
used. The new cooperatives boast towns with modest
three-bedroom houses, schools, libraries, internet service,
meeting halls, and other amenities, centered around a town
plaza adorned with a bust of Simón Bolívar. In both the
cooperatives and in small farming communities, the
government claims to be putting to use land that was left
fallow or underutilized. Individual landowners and the
associations have hired gunmen to protect their property
from land invasions, a situation that has put the owners in
direct conflict with military units working under Chávez’s
614mandate to distribute land to the peasants or to protect
squatters who have moved onto unused land.
Land seizures in Venezuela, as well as Brazil, have
brought to the foreground conflicts that have been a part of
Latin American politics throughout history. The largest
social movement in Latin America currently is the
Landless Workers’ Movement (MST, Movimento dos
Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra), numbering 1.5 million
members in 23 states of Brazil. The appearance of a
movement to reclaim land is not surprising in a country
where just over one percent of landowners control nearly
half (47 percent) of land suitable for cultivation. The MST
began under the dictatorship in the late 1970s, when rural
laborers began to take advantage of the abertura, or
democratic opening, that came into effect shortly before
military rule ended in 1984. The first land seizures
occurred in the southern states of Rio Grande do Sul and
Paraná. The press began to label the squatters as the people
“sem-terra” (the landless ones) and, after some initial
resistance, they eventually adopted an originally pejorative
term for themselves. The first meeting of Landless Rural
Workers took place in 1983 in Cascavel, Paraná, and the
following year the MST officially organized itself at the
national level. Since 1985, the MST has peacefully
occupied unused land, won land titles for more than
350,000 families in 2,000 settlements, and protects
180,000 encamped families currently awaiting government
recognition. As a result of MST agitation and lobbying, the
1988 Brazilian Constitution legalized the rights of
squatters, stating that unproductive land should be used for
a “larger social function.”
615One of the most contentious points in the MST program is
differences between those who seek to increase production
through the use of pesticides and herbicides, and
cooperatives that rely on Bionatur seeds and chemical-free
farming. Disagreements over environmental concerns
among the landless intersects with the “culture of
liberation” adopted by some communities, but not others.
The Ministry of the Environment, with additional support
from private benefactors in Brazil and abroad, supports a
program of environmental education in some communities.
However, although the MST website and many of its
strongest backers point to the communities’ environmental
mission, this is not always the case. Splits in regard to the
need to preserve the natural environment and human
health, uphold gender equality, fight for equality, promote
indigenous rights, and ensure sustainability run through the
MST. Some are convinced that the socialist-oriented
priests and radical organizers who founded the MST and
promoted it as a tool for forging a culture of liberation are
more in favor of the radical agenda than the farmers who
simply joined to make a living. What unites the MST is the
view that families have a right to a sustainable life, and
that the role of the government is to protect those who
fight to provide for themselves by occupying and
cultivating unused land.
Movements for Racial and Gender Equality
While the return to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s in
many Latin American countries was greeted with
enthusiasm by the broad progressive coalitions that had
worked for years to end brutal dictatorships and
authoritarian rule, it is not easy to calculate the extent of
616racial discrimination and movements to overcome it in
Latin America as a whole. The reason for this has to do
with the complicated methods of counting, defining, and
categorizing people of color in the many different
countries and regions of Latin America. As a key historian
of African-descendant people in Latin America, George
Reid Andrews, points out, over 70 percent of blacks live in
one country: Brazil. However, in many countries –
Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, the Caribbean islands,
Panama and other parts of Central America – there are
very many people of mixed-race, or (Reid Andrews’ term)
“browns.” Anti-discrimination movements have been
complicated affairs. Many people of mixed-race
background, who might be identified as “black,” have
shunned black movements because they have seen
themselves as mulatto, or even white, depending on their
occupation, education, and social class. In Brazil in the
1930s, mainly middle-class, urban blacks embraced a
movement for racial equality, the Negro Front (Frente
Negra Brasileira, FNB), and achieved minor success in
pointing out the fallacy of Brazil’s so-called racial
democracy. Getulio Vargas banned the FNB in 1937,
along with all other political parties, but his purpose in this
case was undoubtedly to distinguish any movement by
Afro-descendants to build an autonomous movement.
Andrews argues that middle-class blacks have been more
interested in culturally defined political organizations in
Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America, since the level of
discrimination among educated, urban, middle-class blacks
has been the most overt and has prevented them from
taking higher positions in both the private and public
bureaucracy. Discrimination against blacks for industrial,
617service, and manual labor working-class jobs is less of an
issue. Rather than forming separate political organizations,
black workers have fought for equality and social justice in
trade unions, land and housing occupations, or in the many
social movements apparent throughout the continent.
Movements for indigenous rights have had similar
histories; however, the cultural distinction is more
pronounced. In Guatemala, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and
Mexico, countries with large indigenous populations,
discrimination and isolation have been most keenly felt
among non-Spanish-speaking, culturally non-European
communities. Bolivia’s current crisis, where the eastern
provinces are seeking to separate from Evo Morales’
government, has everything to do with racial prejudice.
Morales’ organization MÁS has the loyalty of the
indigenous majority, calling for recognition of native
languages, educational and governance practices, and an
affirmative action program to provide jobs. The white and
mestizo Bolivians in the wealthier Santa Cruz area refuse
to accept this. Similar to the black–white conflicts of
Brazil, Indians have seen greater gains as members of
trade unions – miners, coca growers, factory laborers –
than in efforts to maintain autonomy.
The musicologist Robin Moore argues that black culture in
Latin America has been “nationalized” or diffused through
the broader society. African-derived music, dance, even
religion, is widely accepted, especially in Brazil, Cuba,
much of Colombia, and the Caribbean in general, but
acceptance of black culture has not meant the end to racial
discrimination. To a lesser extent the Andean music,
especially pan pipes, flutes and other instruments, textiles,
weavings, dance have been mainstreamed in Peru, Bolivia,
618and elsewhere, at least as commodities for tourism.
Indigenous culture is not mainstream, but the impact of
indigenismo is quite profound, extending, by pure weight
of numbers of people and spread of their produce, culture,
and community cohesion, to every corner of Latin
America. For example, the influence of indigenous
aesthetics can be found throughout the San Telmo street
markets in Buenos Aires, along with a growing number of
handicrafts. Argentina has not had a strong presence of
Indian people for a couple hundred years, but many people
from Bolivia, Paraguay, parts of Chile and remote areas of
Argentina are now migrating to the outskirts of the city,
bringing with them their indigenous crafts from which to
make a living in the Buenos Aires marketplaces.
Neoliberal programs resulting in the privatization of
communal lands, agro-industrial encroachment into
regions Indian people have farmed for centuries, loss of
water rights, and an inability to maintain their communities
in the face of a globalized economy, has forced indigenous
people off their land and into shantytowns mushrooming
on the outskirts of cities. Whether they will unite into
single-issue, indigenous rights organizations, or join with
other people of color, industrial or landless workers, will
be the story of the twenty-first century.
Women and Politics
While women have played an important role in trade
unions, religious organizations, communities, and human
rights organizations, the specific agenda of rights for
women did not always make it into the new democratic
agenda. Surprisingly, despite the key role played by
women in the guerrilla movements in El Salvador and
619Nicaragua, demands for reproductive rights, equality in
jobs, and resources for children were relegated to the
backburner. Giocondo Belli’s memoir, The Country Under
My Skin, pointed to a history of male dominance and
sexual exploitation of guerrilleras that undermined the full
acceptance of women as equals in the post-revolutionary
era. In the neoliberal environment that took hold after the
electoral defeat of the Sandinista government in 1990, the
left agenda was reshaped to accommodate conservatives
and appease their harshest critics. The “new” Daniel
Ortega who re-took the presidency in late 2006 was tamed
in every way, but, feminists have argued, his disregard of
women’s rights is not simply a result of conciliating the
right; instead it represents his newfound fundamentalist
Christianity. The only woman who had served as a
commandante during the struggle, Mónica Baltodano,
attributes Ortega’s excessive subservience to the bankers,
the Church, and the conservative US agenda on
reproductive rights to his own political insecurity. Elected
with a hair’s breadth margin, a share of which was won by
promising favors, Ortega has been unwilling to push for
radical reforms.
In another case, Uruguay’s left-liberal president, Tabaré
Vásquez, has vacillated on attempts to decriminalize
abortion. Women’s rights in Uruguay have been at the
center of political tensions between left and right for much
of the twentieth century. Generally heralded as one of the
places where women gained political rights earlier than
other countries – the right to sue for divorce in 1913 and
the right to vote in 1932 – Uruguay has been debating
reproductive rights longer than most other countries, with
the exception of Cuba, Guyana, and Puerto Rico (which
620functions under US constitutional law). The 2005 victory
of the Broad Front (Frente Amplio) was expected to
accelerate the passage of reproductive rights legislation for
women, a proposal backed by many party members and
supported by 63 percent of the population in recent polls.
Despite this widespread support, Tabaré Vásquez has
excluded reproductive rights, prohibition of workplace and
gender-based discrimination, and domestic violence from
his planned reforms in areas such as labor law, social
services, and education. Some critics argue that the current
government’s lack of interest in addressing women’s
oppression stems from the strong influence of the Catholic
Church, and the Frente Amplio’s reluctance to court
disfavor. Others contend that Vásquez is an old-style leftist
and as such sees women’s oppression as ancillary to the
main capital–labor/owner–worker contradiction. Gender
inequality, however, does not easily disappear. In the
1990s Cuba has witnessed a resurgence of prostitution,
racial exploitation of black women, and other signs of
gender and racial discrimination that were supposedly
wiped out in the 30 years of socialism.
Notably it is in Mexico where the most far-reaching
reproductive rights legislation has been passed. Despite the
outspoken opposition of the Catholic Church and Felipe
Calderón’s conservative government, Mexico City has
passed one of the most pro-choice abortion rights laws in
the Americas. The law, upheld in the courts in a challenge
from anti-abortion forces in August 2008, grants full
reproductive rights to any woman or girl, without parental
or spousal consent. This law, placing reproductive choice
in the hands of the woman alone, stands on a par with
621Cuba, European countries, and a few states in the US
known for liberal reproductive laws.
Women and political office
Despite criticisms of the go-slow attitude that has
enveloped some of the left and centerleft governments,
women in Latin America have moved into government
positions at an unprecedented rate, regardless of political
affiliation. At the beginning of 2007 the United Nations
reported that worldwide more women were members of
parliamentary bodies than ever before: a total of 35 out of
262 (13 percent). A number of Latin American nations
have adopted affirmative action-type quotas for the
number of female candidates mandated to run for office on
any given party ticket. In Venezuela, 30 percent of
candidates on a party’s slate must be women; Chile has a
50–50 gender-parity cabinet; Bolivia now requires that 30
percent of all candidates for local and national elections be
women. Even with these measures in place, the pace of
achieving gender equality has been slow. Most Venezuelan
women, for example, do not know of the rule, and in
recent elections even when women were informed of it
they voted for men instead of women to fill party slots.
Such data has to be scrutinized however, since some
anti-Chávez women of the elite class running for office
argued that the Bolivarian reforms were raising the wages
of domestic help. In Bolivia, the 30 percent has thus far
been appropriated by elite, even right-wing, women, and
indigenous and rural women have yet to embrace gender
parity as an important issue. That these measures designed
to increase women’s political participation have been less
622than fully successful does not negate the progress that has
been made thus far.
The beginning of the twenty-first century did find Latin
America’s political profile, both politically and in terms of
gender and race much changed from where it stood a mere
50 years earlier (Figure 14.3). The people of Latin
America have frequently joined together in movements
large and small to win greater freedom and to expand
democratic rights. In this regard they have not differed
from their North American neighbors, who have similarly
forged movements for racial, gender, LGBT, and social
equality. Moreover, as we enter the new millennium, it is
more and more apparent that these previously divided
lands are increasingly overlapping, sometimes creating a
new cultural fusion, often giving rise to tensions and
antagonism.
The Latin Americanization of the United States
At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the number of
people of Latin American origin residing in the United
States had reached more than 41.3 million, comprising
nearly 15 percent of the population. Of that number 60
percent were from Mexico, with the next largest groups
from Central America, the Caribbean, and the rest of Latin
America. It is further estimated that the US is now home to
3.5 million Luso-Americans, or people who claim ancestry
from a Portuguese-speaking country, of which nearly 1
million are from Brazil (Figure 14.4 shows the origins of
all immigrants to the US in 2007). Demographers have
been tracking the rapid increase in what is variously called
the “Hispanic” or “Latino(a)” population for decades, but
623the spread of migrants from Latin America to many parts
of the US broke into the consciousness of the “average
American” in the spring of 2006. From March through
May of that year well over a million people took to the
streets in hundreds of cities and towns throughout the
United States in some of the largest demonstrations in
recent history. They were protesting the passage of HR
4437, a proposed reform of immigration laws sponsored by
Wisconsin Congressman James Sensenbrenner. The bill
had passed the Republican-controlled House of
Representatives the previous December by a margin of 203
to 164 and was sent on to the Senate, with the presumption
that after some tinkering a compromise bill that preserved
the sentiment of the House version would make its way
into law. That did not happen.

Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina and Chilean President

Office of the President of Argentina)
624Figure 14.4 Origins of all immigrants to the United States,
2007.
625Controversy broke out immediately, since the bill
dramatically escalated the penalties for entering and
residing in the US illegally, including classifying as felons
all illegal aliens, along with anyone who knowingly helped
them enter or remain in the country. Since an estimated 12
million immigrants, mainly from Latin America and the
Caribbean, reside without documents throughout the
country, this aspect of the law alarmed a broad spectrum of
people, including anyone faced with helping recently
arrived relatives or friends in distress. Many members of
the social service professions, who are required legally and
ethically to assist those in need of medical care,
counseling, schooling, or advice, regardless of their
citizenship status, protested that the law forced them to
626police their clientele in a manner inconsistent with ethical
and professional guidelines.
Several remarkable features characterized the response to
the bill, highlighting the changes in twenty-first century
America. First, and most obviously, the protests were
massive. Their size and geographic diversity shook the
Washington establishment, both Republican and
Democrat, in a way few other events emanating from the
Latino community had. The largest national turnout
occurred on April 10, 2006 in 102 cities across the
country, including crowds of 50,000–100,000 people in
midwestern and southern states previously unassociated
with large immigrant populations. Moreover, 1,000
protesters in Tijuana blocked for a full day the busiest
international border crossing in the world in support of
rights for the migrants who daily move back and forth
from Mexico to the US. Nearly all of the protests were
peaceful and attracted favorable media attention, although
there was forceful criticism from conservative radio
talk-show hosts, political commentators, right-wing groups
such as the Minutemen, and even from moderate,
non-immigrant citizens regarding what they saw as
“anti-American” symbolism at some of the protests,
especially Mexican flags. Additional rallies in several
cities on May Day drew large crowds and support from
many quarters.
The second important feature of the response to HR 4437
was the way that it highlighted the existence of
Spanish-language media not only in promoting the
protests, but, more fundamentally, as a cultural force with
a widespread impact on a growing segment of the US
627population. The new media, encompassing
Spanish-language radio and television stations, blogs, and
internet sites, was reaching and mobilizing millions of
Americans, indicative of a profound shift in the nation’s
cultural landscape.
The two most important Spanish-language media outlets,
Univision and Telemundo, proved to be enormously
successful in reaching millions of Latinos, while at the
same time unveiling to the non-Latino population a new
force on the US political scene. Univision, the largest
Spanish-language television network and the fifth largest
overall (behind Fox, ABC, NBC, and CBS), began in 1961
in San Antonio, Texas as a subsidiary of the Mexican
Telesistema Mexicano network. Now headquartered in Los
Angeles with major production facilities in Miami,
Univision broadcasts full local news and programming,
both its own and from international networks, through over
50 stations in 24 states, as well as on cable, throughout the
country. Second in size is Telemundo, founded in Hialeah,
Florida in 1984. Newer, and with a smaller market share,
Telemundo is nonetheless huge as media outlets go,
broadcasting through 55 stations in 20 states to an
audience only slightly smaller than that of Univision.
A third distinguishing feature of the protests was the extent
to which they galvanized support from a new audience:
second- and third-generation Latino youth. The internet,
including thousands of personal blogs and chat rooms,
proved very important for reaching this younger cohort of
English-speaking Latinos who identified with the cause of
immigrant rights, even though they spoke little or no
Spanish, Portuguese, or French. Through websites such as
628MySpace and Facebook, the generation of Latin
Americans born in the United States, and/or fully
integrated into the same youth culture as their non-Latino
counterparts were drawn into the protests against HR 4437.
More significantly, a new community of young people
who might have been previously uninvolved, even
uninterested, in the cultural identity of their parents and
grandparents, now found reason to embrace their
“Latinidad.” The protests served as a catalyst for the
assertion of an identity forged from the values of earlier
generations of Latin American immigrants, combined with
the accoutrements of a powerful US youth culture.
Immigration and Free Trade
As the number of legal and illegal immigrants residing in
the US increased throughout the twentieth century and
their presence was felt in regions of the country heretofore
unaccustomed to welcoming recent immigrants – for
example the Midwest and parts of the South – politicians,
civic leaders, educators, trade unionists, and ordinary
citizens became more and more uneasy with the changes
occurring on the national scene. Whereas some of the
hostility toward undocumented workers came from
traditionally conservative sectors, others who nominally
supported the expansion of rights, such as African
Americans, found themselves in competition with
lower-wage Latinos in a declining labor market. Polls have
shown around 40 percent of the estimated 100 million
people living in Mexico report that they would come to the
United States if they had the opportunity and the money.
At $2,500 for the cost of a “coyote” to smuggle them
across the border, many Mexicans, as well as migrants
629from Central America, save for years to make the
dangerous trip, in which between 400 and 600 die yearly
attempting the crossing. The trip seems even more
treacherous when one considers that 75 percent of
Mexican immigrants remain no longer than three years in
the US.
Ironically, one of the main accusations lobbed at illegal
immigrants is their use of resources in the US and thus the
burden placed on the tax payer. According to Douglas S.
Massey, who monitors immigration’s effects on his online
journal, Immigration Daily, “illegal immigrants are less
likely than natives to use public services. While 66 percent
of Mexican immigrants report the withholding of Social
Security taxes from their paychecks and 62 percent say
that employers withhold income taxes, only 10 percent say
they have ever sent a child to U.S. public schools, 7
percent indicate they have received Supplemental Security
Income, and 5 percent or less report ever using food
stamps, welfare, or unemployment compensation.”3
In the debates surrounding the 1993 passage of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), proponents,
especially the Clinton Administration, argued that the
effects of the treaty would dramatically reduce the number
of migrants seeking to enter the US. According to
President Bill Clinton (b. 1946): “There will be less illegal
immigration because more Mexicans will be able to
support their children by staying home,” while Carlos
Salinas de Gortari (b. 1948), Mexico’s president,
proclaimed that in the post-NAFTA era Americans would
get low-cost Mexican tomatoes instead of tomato-pickers.
An expansion of the earlier Canada–US Free Trade
630Agreement of 1988, NAFTA eliminates tariff duties on
products traded among the United States, Canada, and
Mexico and provides for the gradual phasing out of other
tariffs over a 15-year period. Targeted goods include motor
vehicles and automotive parts, computers, textiles, and
agriculture products; protection of intellectual property
rights (patents, copyrights, and trademarks) is also sought.
Some terms of the agreement, such as those covering
agriculture products and industrial goods, were negotiated
bilaterally, but the thrust of the accord was trilateral, with
all provisions to be applied equally among the three
participants. The most contentious areas of the accord,
relating to worker and environmental protections, have
been left to supplemental agreements, called “side
agreements,” which have been signed and implemented
irregularly since 1994.
Rather than broaden Mexico’s prosperity and create jobs,
the effect seems to have been the opposite. Since taking
effect on January 1, 1994 NAFTA has mainly benefited
Mexico’s wealthy landholders and industrialists; an
estimated two million Mexican farmers have been driven
off the land because the corn and grain grown in small
plots could not compete with the better-quality and
cheaper, highly subsidized and mechanized, agriculture
products flooding the Mexican market from the US and
Canada. To illustrate, in 2000 corn producers in the US,
just one group of farmers, received $10.1 billion in
subsidies from Washington. That amount was ten times the
Mexican government’s entire annual agricultural budget
for all farm output in the country. Desperate Mexicans
have left the countryside and poured into the cities where
631few job prospects exist, forcing many to then join the ranks
of migrants crossing into the US to find work.
Opponents Confront Free Trade
The signing of the NAFTA agreement gave rise to the only
major guerrilla-styled insurgency of the late twentieth
century. The movement burst on the scene on New Year’s
Day, 1994 in Chiapas, Mexico, calling for the repeal of
NAFTA on the day it was scheduled to take effect. Led by
a council of 24 Maya Indian comandantes, or
commanders, and one non-Indian sub-commander (the
enigmatic Subcomandante Marcos – see Box 14.2),
hundreds of masked men, women, and children carrying
firearms, sticks fashioned as guns, machetes, and an array
of crude armaments, wearing traditional Indian clothing or
makeshift military uniforms, marched through the state
capital of San Cristóbal de las Casas. In the tradition of the
Sandinistas and El Salvador’s FMLN, the Chiapas
insurgents took the name of a famous revolutionary from
early in the century, Emiliano Zapata. By invoking the
memory of Zapata – the Indian leader from Morelos who
led an army in the 1910 Mexican Revolution – the newly
formed Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN,
Zapatista Army of National Liberation) signaled its intent
to fight for the rights of indigenous people, in a nation that
had left revolution behind in all but slogans and imagery.
The fighting was sporadic; 154 people died in the 1994
uprising, mostly Mayan peasants, and conflict has broken
out again from time to time since.
Before Mexico’s 2006 national elections, the Zapatista
movement focused attention on the inequities of free trade
632(Figure 14.6). Still in existence, the Zapatistas have not
been able to overturn NAFTA, nor to alter the neoliberal
policies embraced by the Mexican government. In 1996
President Vicente Fox conceded to the guerrillas some
autonomy for their region, although the accords are said to
be weakly enforced. The Zapatistas, along with regional,
community, labor, and peasant forces, continue to agitate
for a more equitable distribution of wealth and power.
The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is another
US initiative designed to create a single trade zone. The
FTAA has been on the table since 1994, but only reached
public attention in 2001 during the Summit of the
Americas in Quebec City, Canada. Heated demonstrations,
similar to those in Seattle, Genoa, and Washington, DC
when those cities hosted the meetings of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), erupted in Quebec. A later summit
in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 2005 elicited a similar
round of condemnation, this time under the leadership of
Hugo Chávez, who has called for a union of Latin
American and Caribbean nations that excludes the United
States. To date Chávez has only won a few countries to his
proposed Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas
(Alternativa Bolivariana para las Américas, ALBA),
including Ecuador, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Cuba, but the
notion has not been outright rejected by others. It remains
to be seen whether FTAA or ALBA will succeed, since
without economic powerhouses Brazil and Argentina no
trade agreement will be meaningful or effective. The sharp
economic downturn beginning in September 2008 derailed
nearly all financial and trade agreements in the
hemisphere, for hour long, remains to be seen.
633Box 14.2 Subcomandante Marcos
Despite its indigenous leadership, the most
internationally recognized Zapatista is a white,
educated man known as Subcomandante Marcos
(Figure 14.5), who is thought to be Rafael
Sebastián Guillén Vicente, a former university
philosophy professor with a graduate degree from
the prestigious National Autonomous University of
Mexico (UNAM). Conversant in English, Italian,
and French, as well as Spanish and the indigenous
languages of Chiapas, Subcomandante Marcos is
attractive to an international audience. He is very
media savvy, and has cut a dashing figure both
within Mexico and abroad, helping to promote the
group’s image. He has appeared on 60 Minutes and
other US news shows, been the object of hundreds
of marriage proposals from women writing to
Mexican newspapers, and even set out on a
motorcycle tour of Latin America, reminiscent of
Che Guevara’s travels immortalized in the book
and film The Motorcycle Diaries. Marcos is a
smart politician entirely capable of using the media
to bring attention to the plight of Mexican peasants.

comedic drawing, Mexican artist Francisco Verástegui
uses a battle between two iconic national dishes as a
stand-in for the broader tension between US and Mexican
commerce and culture.
635Immigration and Neoliberalism
Immigrants to the US from Latin America have left their
homes and communities to forge a better life in a distant
land for precisely the same reasons earlier waves of
636immigrants left Ireland, Italy, and other areas of Europe,
pouring into crowded tenements and sweatshops in rapidly
expanding cities in both North and South America. Facing
starvation, political repression, and economic stagnation at
home, millions of people from Europe and Asia in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries pulled up stakes, often
with great reluctance, to make a living in the Americas. In
the late twentieth century, Latin Americans abandoned
lands torn apart by war or, more often, due to the less
dramatic, but equally crushing, impact of day-to-day
poverty to migrate to the United States. A slogan once
splayed across a building in London’s heavily populated
Asian and West Indian East End – “We came here because
you went there” – captures the essence of the mass
migration from former colonies, and subsequent
neo-colonies, to Britain. The slogan applies equally well to
the accelerated emigration of Latin Americans as a
consequence of US intervention in Central America in
1980s and 1990s neoliberal policies. Serious observers and
a few politicians have begun to probe the reasons so many
immigrants from Latin America are desperate enough to
work long hours in dirty, unpleasant, boring, and
dangerous jobs for less than the minimum wage. As the
economic crisis at the end of 2008 deepened, the number
of illegal immigrants crossing the border slowed
precipitously. For the first time in decades, border police
estimated that more migrants seemed to be crossing back
into Mexico than entering the US. Consequently,
remittances declined, a fact that will only increase the
misery of the poor in Mexico, Central America, and the
Caribbean.
637Nevertheless, in September 2006 the US House of
Representatives, followed by the Senate, voted by very
wide margins to authorize the construction of a 700-mile
long fence separating parts of California, Arizona, New
Mexico, and Texas from Mexico. The complex of rolls of
barbed wire, concrete barriers, surveillance cameras, and
guard posts resembles the Berlin Wall that from 1961 to
1989 divided the German city between the Soviet-allied
East and the NATO-allied West. Designed to impede
embarrassing political defections and to stop the flow of
skilled laborers and professionals from abandoning East
Germany for more lucrative careers in the West, the Wall
became a symbol of repression. A steady stream of
individuals embarked on highly creative, daring, and often
deadly, crossings during the Wall’s 28-year existence. The
twenty-first century fence separating the US and Mexico
has generated similar controversy. Supporters argue that it
will reduce crime and drug smuggling, but Democratic
Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas said it would
create “the largest gated community in the Western
hemisphere.” Since the border extends for 2,000 miles,
dividing off a mere 700 miles seems to be little more than
a challenge to desperate migrants to search out other ways
to cross the barren desert landscape or, as in Berlin, to die
trying.
The border wall seeks to stop Mexicans from entering
illegally, but every year thousands of illegal immigrants
from the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti,
and many other countries that do not share a border with
the US enter by overstaying tourist visas. As long as
demand for low-wage labor remains high in the US, and so
long as working conditions, educational opportunities,
638public services, and standards of living in Latin America
continue to lag, people will risk entering illegally. The
Washington Heights neighborhood in upper Manhattan is
home to an estimated three-quarters of a million
Dominicans who work in stores, bars, restaurants, and as
manual laborers in sweatshops and factories, earning the
minimum wage or less. Immigrants living in Washington
Heights, the Jamaica Plain area of Boston, whole sections
of Queens and Brooklyn, south Chicago, much of Florida,
the West and the Southwest send back remittances that
sustain families in Colombia, Mexico, El Salvador, the
Dominican Republic, and other Latin countries. Without
this steady flow of cash from the US, the domestic
economies of more than one Latin American nation would
enter severe crisis.
Finally, obsessive concerns with preventing the flow of
illegal immigrants from Latin America into the US cannot
stop the ethnic transformation already underway. The US
Census Bureau projects that by 2050 the nation’s
demographic makeup will be: “European” white, 50
percent, or less; Hispanic 24 percent; black 15 percent;
Asian 13 percent. Moreover, the Bureau speculates that not
only will the US no longer have a white majority, but that
current racial and ethnic census categories will no longer
be in use because they will no longer be of use. In the
coming decades the process of ethnic and racial mixture
will be so widespread that previous categorizations will
make about as much sense as trying to differentiate today
between the European nationalities that now blend in a sea
of mixed “white” rural, suburban, and metropolitan
neighborhoods.
639Sharing the Environment and the Cost of Stewardship
If anything, the nations of Latin America are more joined
together now than at any time in the modern history of the
hemisphere. From movies and music to baseball, food, and
labor, the cultural and language divide is shrinking and we
are increasingly on the way to becoming a shared
“American” culture. But future relations between North
and South America hinge on something far more
fundamental – the very air we breathe, the water we drink,
and our ability to cooperate as stewards of our shared
environment. This most crucial of all issues also poses the
greatest challenge.
Latin America is home to half of the world’s tropical
forests and nearly half of the plant and animal diversity of
the planet; thus the impact of global warming on the
continent significantly affects the world at large. Scientists
contend that preservation of the Amazon rainforest is
crucial to our very survival. Containing 20 percent of the
world’s fresh water and generating a rainforest where 16
percent of the planet’s species – plant, animal, and human
– reside, the destruction of one of the world’s most
valuable natural resources places us all in jeopardy. The
issue has become increasingly urgent, since it is estimated
that a portion of the rainforest the size of the state of New
Jersey is destroyed each year. In addition, recent
calculations have identified Brazil as the fourth largest
contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, due primarily to
deforestation. Forests are receding elsewhere as well.
Between 1990 and 2005, over 20 percent of Ecuador’s
forest coverage was destroyed as a result of oil operations.
One of the most devastating effects of the current drug
640interdiction program has been the destruction of plant
species, pollution of groundwater, and human health
hazards resulting from spraying the Colombian, Peruvian,
and Bolivian countrysides with a highly toxic herbicide,
Fusarium oxysporum. Despite a study conducted in Florida
that showed the herbicide was a significant threat to the
environment and killed all crops indiscriminately, the US
Congress appropriated funds for aerial spraying.
Latin America has four of the world’s largest 25 rivers,
and three of the largest lakes. Ironically, in an area of the
world with the highest per capita supply of water, the
majority of people are without water for drinking or
sanitation. Intensified global warming has exacerbated this
situation. The American Geophysical Union predicts that
most glaciers in the lower Andes will be gone in a decade,
and total glacial runoff will dry up within the next 20
years. The consequences for residents of Peru, the country
with the most glaciers, and Bolivia, a close second, are
dire, since they rely on fresh water supplies from glaciers
for daily use. Not only are water shortages growing severe,
but melting glaciers have sparked other catastrophes, such
as flooding and mudslides. There are several reasons why
an area of the world with the largest share of the planet’s
water is facing drought. One is poor infrastructure. Mexico
City, a parched and dangerously water-starved city, loses
90 percent of its water because of leaky pipes, a
phenomenon repeated throughout Latin America. Another
reason is the privatization of the water supplies.
IMF-imposed structural adjustment agreements have
mandated the sale of public utilities to private corporations
as conditions for obtaining debt relief. Bolivia’s water was
sold to the Bechtel Corporation, which then raised the cost
641of water by 200 percent. The protests were so intense in
2000 that the government was forced to rescind the
contract, but the huge corporation turned around and filed
suit against Bolivia for $25 million in lost profits.
Global warming affects food production and increases the
spread of dangerous tropical diseases such as malaria and
dengue fever, both of which surfaced in Brazil in 2008.
Another impact of global warming that is already apparent
is the increase in hurricanes as a result of warmer oceans.
The islands of the Caribbean and countries on the Central
American isthmus stand in the direct path of every
hurricane and tropical storm, and have increasingly borne
the brunt of massive destruction and large-scale loss of
human life from major storm events as the frequency of
such storms has increased over the past decade.
If sustainable development is an issue that affects everyone
on the planet, should the costs be shared? Several Latin
American countries have proposed the novel solution of
requesting compensation for refusing to develop resources
that would prove ultimately to harm the environment. For
example, Ecuador has extensive oil supplies that it has not
developed, and cannot afford to drill and refine on its own.
But a past agreement with Texaco had disastrous
consequences. During the 25 years that Texaco operated in
Ecuador, the oil company spilled 17 million gallons of
crude oil into that nation’s waterways, which it has refused
to clean up. Hesitant to enter into another such agreement
and risk the consequences, Ecuador has proposed a new
plan. Instead of inviting one of the major oil companies to
exploit this resource, or relying on Venezuela to refine the
oil, President Rafael Correa has asked the international
642community to compensate Ecuador if it refrains from
opening new oil fields in the Ecuadorian Amazon. As
Correa explains it: “Ecuador doesn’t ask for charity, but
does ask that the international community share in the
sacrifice and compensate us with at least half of what our
country would receive, in recognition of the environmental
benefits that would be generated by keeping this oil
underground.”4
It is estimated that Ecuador is sitting on
anywhere from 900 million to a billion barrels of crude oil
in the Yasuni National Park. Would the international
community, presumably through a UN agency, be willing
to pay to prevent an irreplaceable resource – Ecuador’s
rainforest – from being destroyed by oil exploitation?
Brazil has proposed a similar strategy that would provide
financial compensation for “avoided deforestation,” a plan
whereby individual farmers and indigenous peoples are
given payment for the “environmental service” of not
harming the rainforest.
The plans generated in Ecuador and Brazil lob a direct
challenge to the world at large. A version of this proposal
was adopted at the December 2007 United Nations
Conference on Climate Change in Bali, Indonesia. The 180
nations in attendance agreed in principle to adopt measures
to compensate developing nations for refraining from
exploiting their natural resources, especially cutting down
rainforests. Rather than condemn the developing world for
destroying resources that are essential to the health of the
planet, the richer, more developed nations, who consume
energy at rates hundreds of times greater than the poorer
countries, have been called on to pay to preserve valuable
resources, and thereby the planet. Needless to say, the
bill’s proponents recognize that this challenge to “put your
643money where your mouth is” will only come about through
strict enforcement.
The future of the Americas will hinge on how well the
people and governments of the hemisphere can cooperate.
Despite the many conflicts and differences that have
inflicted far too much damage on the people and land over
the last hundreds of years, there is much to celebrate. Latin
America is a beautiful and rich terrain, the people
resourceful and strong, the possibilities limitless. As the
writer Gabriel García Márquez reminds us, in comparison
with many other parts of the world, especially Europe,
Latin America is still young:
Venerable Europe would perhaps be more perceptive if it
tried to see us in its own past. If only it recalled that
London took three hundred years to build its first city wall,
and three hundred years more to acquire a bishop; that
Rome labored in a gloom of uncertainty for twenty
centuries, until an Etruscan King anchored it in history;
and that the peaceful Swiss of today, who feast us with
their mild cheeses and apathetic watches, bloodied Europe
as soldiers of fortune as late as the Sixteenth Century.5
Latin America too has ancient pre-Columbian civilizations,
but as a continent connected with the rest of the world, it is
in its infancy. If current trends continue, in fact, the people
of the entire hemisphere, North and South, will form a
single cultural entity. What remains to be seen is if
economic and political unity will follow. Rather than a
relationship based on exploitation, destruction of the land
in service of short-term gain, and exhaustion of a finite
supply of natural resources, the future could be built on
644collaboration and respect for people and the natural
environment. It could celebrate the strength of mestizaje –
the mixture of races, the fusing of cultural legacies, the
realization that all people, men and women, all races, and
all ethnic strains, have created a remarkably rich history. If
we are careful, both North and South America will go on
for ages, but the challenge lies squarely in the hands of
those of us who live and work in this hemisphere, and care
deeply about its future. We cannot know precisely what
lies ahead, especially as the world economic indicators
point to possible long-term stagnation, but we must be
aware that the consequences of failing to build a
sustainable and cooperative future are unthinkable.

2 Latin America in 1790
1 Creole refers to people born in the “New World.”
Creoles were of Caucasian, European background,
although the term was sometimes used for others, such as
to distinguish slaves born in America from slaves born in
Africa.
2 Beginning in Columbus’s time the term “Indian” was
used to describe the original inhabitants of the Americas.
While many terms have emerged since that more
accurately and sensitively describe these populations, the
word “Indian” has widespread usage among people of both
indigenous and non-indigenous identity. In this text
“Indian” is used interchangeably with “indigenous,” to
refer to the native populations of the Americas.

3 The period from 1976 to 1983 often has been referred to
as “the Dirty War.” Numerous scholars, both inside
Argentina and outside it, dispute this term. There was no
653“war” since the repression came from one source: the
military. Many civilians who were apprehended were not
military combatants, not involved in the guerrilla
organizations, and had no means of defending themselves.
Also, the idea of “dirty” implied blame on both sides, as
though the military resorted to unseemly, or dirty, tactics
in a battle that was in other ways equal. Scholars of the
period note that the repression and disappearances were in
no way legitimate. I want to thank Argentine colleagues
Cecilia Belej and Alejandra Vassallo from the University
of Buenos Aires Women and Gender Studies Program for
clarifying this point.
